Every investment provides an opportunity for return—but also carries risk.

### Risk

- **Definition:** The possibility that you will lose some or all of the money you invest or that your returns will be less than expected.
- **Types of risk:**
  - *Market Risk*: Values can go up or down due to economic conditions.
  - *Credit Risk*: For bonds, the risk that the issuer cannot pay interest or return principal.
  - *Inflation Risk*: Prices rise faster than your investment grows.
  - *Liquidity Risk*: Difficulty selling your investment when you need your money.

### Return

- **Definition:** The gain (or loss) on your investment over time, usually expressed as a percentage of the initial amount invested.

  $$ \text{Return (\%)} = \frac{\text{Final Value} - \text{Initial Value}}{\text{Initial Value}} \times 100 $$

- **Example:** If you buy stock for $200 and sell it for $250,
  
  $$
  \text{Return (\%)} = \frac{250 - 200}{200} \times 100 = 25\%
  $$

### The Risk-Return Tradeoff

- **Principle:** Higher potential returns usually require taking higher risks. Investments like stocks have historically offered higher returns but are more volatile. Bonds are less risky but usually offer lower returns.
