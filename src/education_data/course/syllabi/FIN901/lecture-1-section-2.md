Why is financial literacy important? Both at the personal and societal level, financial literacy has wide-ranging impacts.

- **Personal Security:** Knowing how to manage money reduces stress and enables individuals to weather unexpected expenses.
- **Long-term Planning:** Informed financial choices lead to better saving, investing, and retirement planning.
- **Avoiding Debt Traps:** Understanding interest rates and loan terms helps people steer clear of high-cost debt and financial pitfalls.
- **Economic Participation:** Financially literate individuals are more likely to start businesses, invest, and drive economic growth.
- **Consumer Protection:** Being able to read and understand contracts, disclosures, and financial products helps consumers avoid fraud and predatory practices.

**Example:** Suppose you receive a credit card offer in the mail. A financially literate person will look beyond the marketing slogans and check the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), fees, and terms. This minimizes the likelihood of falling into unsustainable debt.
