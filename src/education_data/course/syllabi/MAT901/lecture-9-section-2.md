A **hypothesis** is a statement about a population parameter (like the mean or proportion).

### Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)

- Represents the "no change," "no effect," or status quo.
- The statement you test directly.
- Example: $H_0$: The mean exam score is 70 ($\mu = 70$).

### Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_A$)

- Represents what you want to support or demonstrate.
- Indicates the presence of an effect or a difference.
- Example: $H_A$: The mean exam score is not 70 ($\mu \neq 70$).

#### Types of Alternative Hypotheses

- **Two-tailed:** $H_A: \mu \neq 70$ (mean is different from 70).
- **Left-tailed:** $H_A: \mu < 70$ (mean is less than 70).
- **Right-tailed:** $H_A: \mu > 70$ (mean is greater than 70).

**Note:** The form of $H_A$ determines the "direction" of your test.
