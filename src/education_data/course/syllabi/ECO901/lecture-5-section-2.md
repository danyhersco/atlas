### What is Aggregate Demand?

Aggregate Demand (AD) is the total quantity of goods and services demanded across all levels of an economy at a given overall price level and in a given time period.

Formally, it is the sum of expenditures on domestic goods and services:
$$
AD = C + I + G + NX
$$

Where:
- $C$ = Consumption
- $I$ = Investment
- $G$ = Government spending
- $NX$ = Net exports (Exports - Imports)

### The Aggregate Demand Curve

The AD curve represents the relationship between the total quantity of goods and services demanded (on the horizontal axis) and the price level (on the vertical axis).

**Why is the AD Curve downward sloping?**

1. **Wealth (Real Balances) Effect:** 
   - As the price level falls, the real purchasing power of money increases, encouraging higher consumption.

2. **Interest Rate Effect:** 
   - A lower price level reduces the demand for money, leading to lower interest rates, which encourages investment and some types of consumption.

3. **International Trade Effect:**
   - A lower domestic price level makes exported goods cheaper for foreigners, increasing exports (NX), and makes imports more expensive, reducing imports.

**Example:**
Suppose the overall price level in the economy drops. Consumers feel wealthier, interest rates fall so borrowing for investment is cheaper, and domestic goods become more competitive abroad. All these effects raise aggregate demand.

### Determinants of Aggregate Demand

- **Changes to $C$, $I$, $G$, or $NX$ shift the AD curve:**
    - Increase in consumer confidence → higher $C$ → AD shifts right.
    - Higher government spending ($G$) → AD shifts right.
    - A recession in trading partners reduces $NX$ → AD shifts left.

**Other Factors:**
- Fiscal policy: Changes in taxes and government spending.
- Monetary policy: Changes in money supply influence interest rates.
- Exchange rates: Affect competitiveness and net exports.
