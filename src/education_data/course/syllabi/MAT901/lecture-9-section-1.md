Hypothesis testing is a formal statistical approach used to decide whether the data provides enough evidence to reject a given hypothesis about a population parameter. It lies at the heart of inferential statistics, bridging the gap between sample data and broader conclusions about populations. Understanding how to set up, perform, and interpret hypothesis tests is essential for anyone working with data.

### Key Concepts

- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** The default claim or status quo that there is no effect or no difference.
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_A$):** The claim that contradicts or challenges the null hypothesis, suggesting an effect or a difference.
- **Test Statistic:** A value calculated from the sample data that is used to decide whether to reject $H_0$.
- **p-value:** The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, under the assumption that $H_0$ is true.
- **Significance Level ($\alpha$):** The threshold for deciding when to reject $H_0$, typically 0.05 (5%).
- **Type I and Type II Errors:** Two possible errors in hypothesis decision-making.
