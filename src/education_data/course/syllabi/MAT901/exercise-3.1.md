A bag contains 6 green and 4 yellow balls. Two balls are drawn *without replacement*.

1. Find the probability that both balls are green.
2. What is the probability that the second ball is green given that the first was green?
3. Are the events "first ball is green" and "second ball is green" independent? Explain your reasoning.
