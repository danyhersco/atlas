In probability theory, everything starts with the notion of an *experiment*—any process or action that leads to an outcome. For example: tossing a coin, rolling a die, drawing a card from a deck.

- **Sample Space (S):** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
  - Example: When tossing a fair coin, $S = \{\text{Heads}, \text{Tails}\}$
  - Example: When rolling a six-sided die, $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$

- **Event:** Any subset of the sample space. Events may include one or more outcomes.
  - Example: Getting an even number when rolling a die, $E = \{2, 4, 6\}$

*Note:* The *empty set*, $\emptyset$, (no outcomes) and the entire sample space $S$ are also considered events.

**Exercise with Sample Spaces**

- Given the experiment: Drawing a card from a standard deck of 52 cards.
  - What is the sample space?
  - Give an example event: "Drawing a heart."
