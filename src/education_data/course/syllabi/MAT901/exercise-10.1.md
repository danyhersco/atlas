**Case Study Analysis**

Read the following scenario and answer the questions below.

*A new teaching method is tested in schools to improve math scores. 200 students are randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 (traditional) and Group 2 (new method). After six months:*

- *Group 1 Mean Score: 75, SD: 10, n=100*
- *Group 2 Mean Score: 78, SD: 12, n=100*

a) What kind of statistical test would you use to assess whether the new method led to a significant difference in scores?

b) Interpret what a 95% confidence interval for the difference in means that does **not** contain zero tells you in this context.
