A budget is a financial plan for a defined period, usually a month. At its core, a budget helps you:

- **Understand your financial situation**: Know how much money you bring in (income) and how much goes out (expenses).
- **Control spending**: Prevents overspending and helps prioritize what matters most to you.
- **Achieve financial goals**: Whether paying off debt, saving for a big purchase, or investing, a budget ensures you have a roadmap.
- **Prepare for emergencies**: Sets aside money for unexpected expenses.
- **Reduce financial stress**: Provides a sense of control over your finances.

**Example**:  
Sam earns $2000 a month and wants to save $400 each month to build an emergency fund. By creating a budget, Sam can allocate $400 for savings, $1200 for living expenses, and the rest for discretionary spends, reducing guesswork and worry.
