Just finding a p-value or confidence interval is not enough—interpretation is crucial.

### Interpreting p-values

- **p-value < 0.05** (commonly used threshold): The result is statistically significant. There is evidence **against** the null hypothesis.
- **p-value >= 0.05**: The result is **not** statistically significant. There is **not enough evidence** to reject the null hypothesis.

**Important Caution:** Statistical significance does not mean practical significance! A very large sample size can make tiny, insignificant effects statistically "significant."

### Confidence Intervals

A 95% confidence interval for a mean of (8.6 mmHg, 11.4 mmHg) means:

> "We are 95% confident that the **true mean** decrease in blood pressure (for the population) is between 8.6 and 11.4 mmHg."

This does **not** mean "there is a 95% probability that the mean is in this interval"—once the interval is computed, it either contains the mean or it does not.
