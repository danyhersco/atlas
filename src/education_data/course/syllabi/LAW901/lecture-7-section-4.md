While fundamental, rights are not absolute. Constitutions often set conditions, limitations, or derogations on rights to balance them with other public interests.

### Permissible Limitations

Most modern constitutions follow international norms: rights can be limited if the restriction is:
- **Prescribed by law**
- Pursues a **legitimate aim** (e.g., public order, national security, public health)
- Is **necessary and proportionate**

**Examples:**
- Freedom of expression may be restricted to prevent incitement to violence.
- During emergencies (war, natural disasters), some rights can be temporarily suspended, but core rights (e.g., prohibition of torture) must never be violated.

### Doctrine of Proportionality

Courts often apply the **proportionality test**:

1. **Legitimate objective:** Is the aim worthy (e.g., protecting national security)?
2. **Suitability:** Is the measure suitable to achieve the aim?
3. **Necessity:** Are less restrictive measures available?
4. **Balance:** Is the restriction proportionate to the benefit gained?

#### Illustration

A law bans all public demonstrations to “ensure national security.” Is this proportionate? Likely not. A more tailored restriction (e.g., requiring notice or limiting only demonstrations that threaten violence) would better balance rights and security.
