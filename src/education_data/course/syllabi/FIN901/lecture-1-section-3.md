Financial knowledge applies both at the individual (personal finance) and business (corporate finance) levels, but the focus and context are different.

### Personal Finance

Deals with the management of an individual's or household's financial activities, such as:

- Budgeting monthly expenses
- Savings planning
- Retirement investing (e.g. 401(k), IRAs)
- Managing credit and loans
- Tax planning

### Corporate Finance

Focuses on the financial activities of businesses, including:

- Raising capital through debt or equity
- Evaluating investment projects (capital budgeting)
- Managing company assets and liabilities
- Financial reporting
- Risk management

**Example:**  
- **Personal:** Deciding whether to finance a car purchase with a loan, and comparing loan offers.
- **Corporate:** A business deciding whether to fund a new project by borrowing from a bank or by issuing shares.

Understanding both is important, as many financial principles (like time value of money, risk and return, budgeting) are shared, but the scale and application differ.
