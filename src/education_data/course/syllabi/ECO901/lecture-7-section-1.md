Economic growth refers to the increase in the value of goods and services produced by an economy over time. It is a central goal of most macroeconomic policies, as sustained growth leads to higher living standards, greater employment opportunities, and improved public services.

Growth is often discussed in two forms:
- **Short-run growth:** Year-to-year increases in output, often due to fuller use of existing resources (reducing unemployment, increasing capacity utilization).
- **Long-run growth:** An upward shift in the economy's productive capacity, often tied to increased resources, technological advances, or improvements in productivity.

**Key Concept:**
- Economic growth is conventionally measured as the percentage increase in Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or Real GDP per capita over time.
