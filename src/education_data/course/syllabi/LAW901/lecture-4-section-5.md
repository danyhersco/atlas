While the separation of powers is foundational to many democracies, its implementation varies.

### United States

- **Clear and formal separation:** Three branches are distinct and structurally independent.
- **President is not a member of the legislature.**
- **Strong judicial review.**

### United Kingdom

- **Fusion of powers between executive and legislature:** Prime Minister is a member of Parliament.
- **Judicial independence established more recently (Supreme Court created in 2009).**
- **Lack of codified constitution makes for flexible adaption.**

### France

- **Semi-presidential system:** Both a President and Prime Minister with shared executive functions.
- **Constitutional Council reviews legislation before enactment.**

### Parliamentary vs. Presidential Systems

- **Presidential system** (e.g., U.S.): Strict separation, independently elected executive.
- **Parliamentary system** (e.g., UK, Canada): Executive derives legitimacy from the legislature.
- **Hybrid systems** (e.g., France, Russia): Blend features of both.
