Having built financial security, you must maintain it throughout your life:

### Good Practices

- **Update Your Risk Management Plan:** Life changes; keep your coverage and emergency plans up to date.
- **Continue Saving and Investing:** Even after you hit your main goals, maintain discipline to adjust for inflation, changing goals, and surprises.
- **Diversify Assets:** Spread your investments to minimize risk.
- **Monitor and Reduce Debt:** High interest debts (like credit cards) threaten your security.

### Financial Health Indicators

- A well-funded emergency fund (3 to 6 months’ expenses)
- Appropriate insurance coverage for your risks
- Clear, realistic, and updated retirement saving goals
- Low and manageable levels of debt
- Ability to navigate financial surprises without major setbacks
