Suppose we take many samples from the same population and for each sample calculate a statistic (like the mean).

- **Sampling distribution**: The probability distribution of a statistic (e.g., sample mean) calculated from *all possible samples* of a certain size from the population.

### Why Is This Important?

- The sampling distribution tells us how much the sample statistic is likely to **vary** from sample to sample.
- It provides the **basis for statistical inference** (such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing).
