### The Solow Growth Model (Basics)

The Solow growth model is a framework used to understand the mechanics of economic growth over time, emphasizing capital accumulation, labor or population growth, and technological advancement.

In its simplest form, output (Y) depends on capital (K), labor (L), and technology (A):

$$
Y = A \cdot F(K, L)
$$

Where:
- $Y$: Output (GDP)
- $K$: Physical capital
- $L$: Labor input
- $A$: Total factor productivity (technology)

**Key implications:**
- Increases in $K$ and $L$ raise output, but with diminishing returns.
- Sustained long-term growth in output per worker requires technological progress (increasing $A$).

### Capital Deepening vs. Technological Progress

- **Capital deepening:** More capital per worker boosts output, but due to diminishing returns, its effect lessens over time.
- **Technological progress:** Shifts the production function upward, allowing for continued growth in output per worker even without increases in capital, largely overcoming the limits imposed by diminishing returns.

### Example: Growth Accounting

Suppose a country increases the number of machines (K), its workforce (L), and also introduces new technology (A). Output rises, but growth accounting can decompose what proportion of the increase comes from:
- More machines
- More workers
- Smarter production (technology)

If labor force and capital stock have barely grown, but output grows quickly, technological progress must be an important source.
