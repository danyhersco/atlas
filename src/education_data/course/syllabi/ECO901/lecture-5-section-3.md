### What is Aggregate Supply?

Aggregate Supply (AS) is the total quantity of goods and services firms in an economy are willing to produce at various price levels.

**Distinction:**
- **Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS):** Some input prices (like wages) are sticky and do not adjust immediately.
- **Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS):** Input prices are fully flexible; output depends only on productive resources, technology, and institutions—**not** on the price level.

### The Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve (SRAS)

- **Shape:** Upward sloping.
- **Reason:** When prices of final goods/services rise but input prices are sticky, firms' profits rise, so they increase production.

**Example:**
If the price level rises unexpectedly, but wages are based on past expectations and remain unchanged, firms can earn higher profits by producing more.

### The Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve (LRAS)

- **Shape:** Vertical at potential (full-employment) output.
- **Reason:** In the long run, all prices and wages are flexible. Output is determined by resources and technology, not by the price level.

**Potential Output:**
- The economy’s sustainable level of output, also called natural output or full-employment output ($Y^*$).
