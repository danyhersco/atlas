Probability and statistics underpin modern decision-making in diverse fields:

- **Science and Engineering**: Analyzing experimental results, error estimation.
- **Business**: Market analysis, risk assessment.
- **Medicine**: Clinical trials, epidemiology.
- **Sports**: Player statistics, probability of winning.
- **Policy and Government**: Polls, census data, economic forecasts.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning algorithms rely heavily on statistical inference and probability models.

**Example: Drug Effectiveness**

In clinical trials, probability helps determine the likelihood that observed results (e.g., recovery from a disease) are due to the new drug and not just random chance.
