In a certain population, 5% of people are left-handed. A random person is selected.

1. Let $L$ be the event "the person is left-handed," and $R$ be "the person writes with their right hand." Are $L$ and $R$ independent? Why or why not?
2. Suppose further that 70% of left-handed people write with their left hand, and 1% of right-handed people also write with their left hand. What is the probability that a randomly selected person writes with their left hand?
