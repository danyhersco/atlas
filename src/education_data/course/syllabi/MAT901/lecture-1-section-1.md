**Probability** is the branch of mathematics that deals with quantifying uncertainty. It allows us to model and analyze situations where the outcome is not deterministic, and instead, several outcomes are possible — but with different likelihoods.

### Example: Rolling a Die

Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each outcome is equally likely. The probability of any specific outcome (say, rolling a 4) is:

$$
P(\text{rolling a 4}) = \frac{\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

### Everyday Examples

- **Weather Forecasting**: "There’s a 30% chance of rain tomorrow."
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Probabilities can state how likely a test is to detect a disease if it is present.
- **Games and Gambling**: How likely are you to win at a particular card game?

Probability provides the framework to model and reason about these uncertainties.
