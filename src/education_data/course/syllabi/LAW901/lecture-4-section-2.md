The separation of powers is a doctrine designed to prevent the concentration of governmental authority by dividing it among distinct branches. The modern articulation of this principle is commonly attributed to Montesquieu, an 18th-century French philosopher, who argued that liberty is most secure when the legislative, executive, and judicial functions are vested in separate entities.

**Key rationales for separation of powers:**
- **Prevention of tyranny:** No single person or group should have total control.
- **Efficiency and specialization:** Each branch focuses on its primary function.
- **Accountability:** Separation allows for internal checks, making abuse of power more difficult.

### Historical Context

- **Classical roots:** Aristotle and Polybius discussed different governmental functions, but did not conceptualize them as requiring separation.
- **British influence:** Montesquieu admired the English system, albeit misinterpreting some of its features.
- **American adoption:** The U.S. Constitution enshrines a strict form of separation, making it a model for other democracies.
