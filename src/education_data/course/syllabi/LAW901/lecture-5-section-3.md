### Defending Fundamental Rights

Courts protect citizens from overreach by the government by enforcing constitutional limitations. This includes safeguarding fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, due process, equal protection, and more.

#### Example: Habeas Corpus

If a citizen is unlawfully detained, courts can issue a writ of habeas corpus, compelling the government to justify the detention or release the individual.

### Balancing Powers Between Branches

When disputes arise between executive, legislative, and judicial branches, courts act as the arbiters to maintain checks and balances. Their role isn't merely negative (annulling illegal state actions) but also constructive, shaping the boundaries of governmental authority.
