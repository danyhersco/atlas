In the preceding lectures, we examined foundational probability concepts and key probability distributions. We will now pivot to **descriptive statistics**: the toolkit for summarizing, organizing, and presenting data. Descriptive statistics help us understand large data sets by reducing them to a few key figures and useful graphics.

This lecture covers:

- Types of Data
- Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
- Measures of Dispersion: Variance, Standard Deviation
- Visualizing Data with Histograms and Boxplots
