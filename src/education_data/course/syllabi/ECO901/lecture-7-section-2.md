### Real GDP and Real GDP per Capita

- **Real GDP:** Measures the value of all goods and services produced, adjusted for changes in price level (inflation).
- **Real GDP per capita:** Divides real GDP by the population, providing insight into average living standards.

### Growth Rate Calculation

The growth rate of real GDP (or per capita real GDP) is calculated as:

$$
\text{Growth Rate} = \frac{\text{GDP}_{\text{current}} - \text{GDP}_{\text{previous}}}{\text{GDP}_{\text{previous}}} \times 100\%
$$

**Example:**
Suppose a country's real GDP was $500 billion in year 1 and $525 billion in year 2.
$$
\text{Growth Rate} = \frac{525 - 500}{500} \times 100\% = 5\%
$$

### Productivity

Productivity is a key determinant of economic growth and refers to the amount of output produced per unit of input, typically per worker or per hour worked.

- **Labor Productivity:** 
$$
\text{Labor Productivity} = \frac{\text{Total Output}}{\text{Number of Workers or Hours Worked}}
$$

Improvements in productivity allow more goods and services to be produced with the same amount of labor and resources, fueling higher growth without simply increasing resource use.

> **Key Difference:** Output can grow by employing more people (extensive growth) or by making each worker more productive (intensive growth). Sustainable long-run growth relies on increases in productivity.
