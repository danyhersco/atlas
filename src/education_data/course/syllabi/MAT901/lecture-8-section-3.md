A single value rarely tells the full story, especially since a sample is just one of many possibilities. **Interval estimates** provide a range of plausible values for the population parameter, reflecting uncertainty due to sampling variability.

A **confidence interval (CI)** is the most common type of interval estimate in statistics.

**General structure:**
$$
\text{Estimate} \pm (\text{Margin of Error})
$$

**Interpretation:**
- "We are X% confident that the true parameter lies within this interval."
