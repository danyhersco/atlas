**Statistics** is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. While probability predicts the likelihood of future events, statistics involves analyzing data from the real world to learn about phenomena.

### Two Main Areas

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Methods to summarize or describe data (e.g., calculating the average height in a class).
- **Inferential Statistics**: Methods to make predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample (e.g., polling 100 people to estimate national election results).

#### Example: Survey Results

Suppose you survey 100 students about their favorite fruit. If 40 say "banana", you use statistics to describe (descriptive) and, possibly, infer about all students (inferential).
