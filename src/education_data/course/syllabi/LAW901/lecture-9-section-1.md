In the previous lectures, we developed a foundational understanding of public law: its origins, structures, and its pivotal role in binding together the constitution, rights, courts, and democratic institutions. Today, we will apply these abstract concepts to real-world situations by examining influential case studies. By analyzing the reasoning, outcomes, and broader impacts of landmark cases, we will deepen our appreciation of how public law operates in society, shapes institutions, and protects individual rights.
