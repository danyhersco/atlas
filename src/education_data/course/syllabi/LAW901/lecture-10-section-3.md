### 1. The Erosion or Strengthening of Constitutional Norms

In recent years, some countries have experienced "democratic backsliding" — the weakening of democratic norms, sometimes through the manipulation of constitutional mechanisms:

- **Attempts to undermine judicial independence**
- **Elimination of term limits for executive leaders**
- **Use of emergency powers to circumvent ordinary legal procedures**

**Discussion**: How can constitutional design and public law institutions help safeguard against such trends?

### 2. The Rise of Transnational Law and Institutions

Problems like climate change, human rights abuses, and multinational corporate power require legal frameworks that go beyond the nation-state:

- **International law** (e.g., the UN system, human rights treaties) can exert influence on national public law.
- **Hybrid mechanisms** such as international tribunals or cross-border regulatory agencies.

**Example**: The International Criminal Court's role in prosecuting heads of state for crimes against humanity.

### 3. Migration and Public Law

Large-scale migration places pressure on existing legal and political systems:

- Who has the authority to grant or restrict entry?
- To what extent do constitutional rights extend to non-citizens?

Legal frameworks must balance sovereign power with international obligations (e.g., regarding refugees).

### 4. Environmental Law as Public Law

- How do constitutions respond to demands for environmental protection or recognition of collective rights (e.g., the right to a healthy environment)?
- What is the role of courts in enforcing such rights?

**Example**: Several courts globally have recognized a constitutional right to environmental protection, sometimes granting legal standing to communities or even natural entities (such as rivers).
