Suppose the Federal Reserve wants to lower short-term interest rates. It purchases $100 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks.

- The Fed credits the banks' reserve accounts with $100 million.
- Banks have more reserves and can lend more freely.
- Increased lending lowers the federal funds rate.
- Firms and consumers find it easier to borrow, stimulating spending and investment.
