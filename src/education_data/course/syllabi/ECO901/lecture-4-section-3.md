The unemployment rate is a widely used metric, but its calculation hides important nuances.

### Unemployment Rate Formula

Let $U$ = number of unemployed people, $L$ = number of people in the labor force.

$$
\text{Unemployment Rate} = \frac{U}{L} \times 100\%
$$

#### Example

If a country has 1,000 people in the labor force, and 90 are unemployed:

$$
\text{Unemployment Rate} = \frac{90}{1000} \times 100\% = 9\%
$$

#### Labor Force Participation Rate

The fraction of the adult population that is in the labor force.

Let $N$ = adult population.

$$
\text{Labor Force Participation Rate} = \frac{L}{N} \times 100\%
$$

#### Example

If the adult population is 1,200, then:

$$
\text{Labor Force Participation Rate} = \frac{1000}{1200} \times 100\% = 83.3\%
$$

### Limitations of the Unemployment Rate

- **Discouraged Workers:** Those who have stopped searching for jobs are not counted as unemployed.
- **Underemployment:** Part-time workers who want full-time jobs and people working below their skill levels are counted as employed.
- **Misreporting:** Survey respondents may misclassify their status.
