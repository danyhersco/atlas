Before you start investing, it's important to have a strategy. Here are some foundational approaches:

### 1. Diversification

- **Definition:** Spreading your money across many types of investments to reduce risk.
- **Example:** Instead of putting all your savings into one company's stock, you buy shares in different companies, sectors, and perhaps some bonds.

### 2. Asset Allocation

- **Definition:** Deciding how much of your money to invest in different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash, etc.)
- **Why?** Your chosen allocation should match your goals, age, and willingness to take risks.
- **Example Strategy:** At a young age, you might allocate 70% to stocks and 30% to bonds; as you near retirement, you might switch to 40% stocks and 60% bonds.

### 3. Dollar-Cost Averaging

- **Definition:** Investing a fixed dollar amount on a regular schedule, regardless of share price.
- **Purpose:** Helps reduce the impact of market volatility, as sometimes you buy when prices are high and sometimes when they are low, averaging the cost over time.
- **Example:**
  
  Suppose you invest $100 every month. If prices fall, you buy more shares; if they rise, you buy fewer. Over time, your average cost per share is balanced.

### 4. Long-Term Investing

- **Definition:** Holding investments for years (not days or weeks), allowing your money to grow and compound.
- **Advantage:** Reduces the effect of short-term market swings and potentially lowers taxes on gains.

### 5. Understanding Your Goals and Risk Tolerance

- **Know Your Purpose:** Are you saving for retirement, a home, or a large expense?
- **Assess Risk Tolerance:** Are you comfortable with seeing your investments fluctuate in value?
