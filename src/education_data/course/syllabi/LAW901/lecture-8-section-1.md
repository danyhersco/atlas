Public law is intrinsically linked to the foundation and maintenance of democratic institutions. Democracy, in its modern sense, requires not only the election of representatives but also the assurance of fair processes, the protection of rights, and the accountability of those who wield public power. Public law provides the legal backbone that shapes, limits, and enables democratic governance.

### The Relationship Between Public Law and Democracy

- **Definition of Democracy**: At its core, democracy is a system of government where power rests with the people, either directly or through elected representatives.
- **Public Law's Role**: Public law establishes the framework for democratic participation (elections, referenda), defines governmental powers and responsibilities, and guarantees rights essential for meaningful participation (freedom of speech, assembly, association).

#### Example: Electoral Laws

Electoral laws (a branch of public law) set rules for who can vote, how votes are counted, and how electoral districts are drawn. By doing so, they directly affect the fairness and legitimacy of democratic processes.

#### Example: Access to Justice

Public law ensures that citizens can challenge the government through courts, safeguarding individual rights and providing mechanisms for resolving disputes that threaten democratic fairness.
