### Stabilizing the Business Cycle

Fiscal policy seeks to smooth the business cycle through countercyclical measures:
- **During Recessions:** Implement expansionary fiscal policy (increase spending, cut taxes).
- **During Booms:** Use contractionary fiscal policy (decrease spending, increase taxes).

### Short-Run and Long-Run Effects

- **Short-run:** Fiscal policy primarily influences aggregate demand.
- **Long-run:** Sustained deficits and rising public debt can “crowd out” private investment, potentially reducing economic growth.

### Crowding Out

If government borrowing raises interest rates, it may reduce private investment—a phenomenon called **crowding out**.

**Example:**
Let’s say the government needs to borrow more. This increases demand for loanable funds, pushing up the interest rate, making it more expensive for private businesses to borrow and invest.

### Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth

Well-targeted fiscal policy can stimulate long-term growth by:
- Investing in infrastructure
- Funding education and research
- Supporting innovation

Poorly executed fiscal policies, or excessive deficits, can hinder growth by:
- Raising interest rates
- Increasing future tax burdens
- Destabilizing public finances

### Automatic Stabilizers

Some fiscal mechanisms kick in automatically as economic conditions change, without new government action. These **automatic stabilizers** include:
- Progressive income taxes (tax revenues fall in recessions, rise in booms)
- Unemployment benefits (increase during downturns, decrease in expansions)

These help dampen the amplitude of business cycle fluctuations.

### Discretionary Fiscal Policy

**Discretionary policy** refers to deliberate changes in spending or taxation by the government (new laws or budgets), as opposed to automatic stabilizers.

#### Implementation Lags

Fiscal policy suffers from **lags**:
- *Recognition Lag*: Time to identify economic changes.
- *Decision Lag*: Time to pass legislation.
- *Implementation Lag*: Time to put changes into action.

For this reason, timing and targeting are essential for effective fiscal interventions.
