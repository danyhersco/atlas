### Case Study 1: The United States – “Commerce Clause” Disputes

The Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate commerce among states. The scope of this power has been highly contested. For instance:
- *Wickard v. Filburn* (1942): Upheld broad federal power over even local activities if they affect interstate commerce.
- *United States v. Lopez* (1995): Limited Congress’s power, holding that some activities (e.g., gun possession near schools) were beyond the reach of federal regulation.

### Case Study 2: Canada – Health Care

Healthcare is primarily a provincial matter (Section 92), but national government funds and sets conditions via the Canada Health Act. This can create tensions—provincial autonomy vs. federal standards.

### Case Study 3: India – President’s Rule

India’s constitution allows the central government to take over state administration in certain emergencies (Articles 355–356). This “unitary tilt” has sparked controversy about the proper balance between union and states.

### Case Study 4: Australia – High Court Interpretations

Australia’s High Court has expanded federal power (notably through the “corporations power” and spending power), often narrowing the states' fiscal and legislative space.
