Constitutions are the bedrock of fundamental rights. They outline not only the rights themselves, but also how individuals can claim them and what institutions enforce them.

### Entrenchment and Justiciability

**Entrenchment** means these rights are incorporated into the constitution in such a way that they are difficult to amend or remove.

**Justiciability** refers to the ability of individuals to bring cases before courts if their rights are violated.

#### Example
Suppose a constitution states:  
“No person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”

- If a government act breaches this, citizens can seek judicial review.

### Role of Courts

Courts interpret and enforce fundamental rights, generally acting as guardians against governmental overreach.  
- **Remedies** can include orders to stop violations, compensation, or even striking down laws as unconstitutional.

**Example:**
If a law banning peaceful protests is challenged, courts assess if it unjustly limits freedom of assembly.

### Institutional Mechanisms

- **Ombudsmen**: Investigate complaints about rights violations.
- **Human rights commissions**: Promote and protect rights, and sometimes receive petitions.
