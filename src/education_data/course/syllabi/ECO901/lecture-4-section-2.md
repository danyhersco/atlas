Unemployment refers to the condition of people who are able and willing to work, are actively seeking work, but cannot find employment. The unemployment rate is a key measure that captures this aspect of the economy, but understanding what lies beneath this simple statistic requires a deeper look.

### Key Labor Market Statistics

- **Labor Force**: The sum of all employed and unemployed individuals (who are actively seeking work) in the economy.
- **Employed**: Individuals who have worked for pay (or profit) during the reference period, or who have jobs from which they are temporarily absent.
- **Unemployed**: Individuals without work who are available for work and have actively sought employment in the recent past (usually the previous four weeks).
- **Not in the Labor Force**: Individuals who are neither employed nor actively seeking work (e.g., retirees, students not seeking work, homemakers).
