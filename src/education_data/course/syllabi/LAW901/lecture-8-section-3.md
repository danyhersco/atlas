A functional democracy must operate within a system where law governs both the rulers and the ruled. 

### The Rule of Law

**Definition**: The principle that all individuals and institutions are subject to, and accountable under, the law.

- **Implications for Democracy**:
  - Governmental authority derives from and is limited by law.
  - Arbitrary use of power is curtailed.
  - Consistency, predictability, and fairness in legal matters are promoted.

### Accountability in Democratic Institutions

- **Political Accountability**: Elected representatives are answerable to the electorate through elections.
- **Legal Accountability**: Government officials and institutions are subject to court actions and legal scrutiny.
- **Institutional Accountability**: Checks and balances (as previously discussed) provide mechanisms for oversight.

#### Example: Impeachment Procedures

Procedures for removing elected officials found guilty of misconduct are mandated through public law, embodying the principle that no one is above the law.

#### Example: Freedom of Information Acts

Legislation obligating government transparency increases the accountability of public officials and agencies, allowing citizens to monitor and watchdog power.
