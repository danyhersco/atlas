The *time value of money* is the principle that a sum of money now is worth more than the same sum in the future, due to its potential earning capacity. Money in hand today can be invested to earn interest or returns, making it more valuable.

**Key idea:** Money earns money over time if invested or saved at an interest rate.

### Present Value and Future Value

- **Future Value (FV):** How much a sum will grow after earning interest for some time.
- **Present Value (PV):** What a future sum is worth today, discounted by a given rate.

#### Future Value (Compound Interest):

$$
FV = PV \times (1 + r)^t
$$

#### Present Value (Discounting Future Cash Flow):

$$
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

##### Example

How much must you invest today at 6% annual interest, compounded once per year, to have $2,000 in 5 years?

$$
PV = \frac{2000}{(1 + 0.06)^5} = \frac{2000}{1.3382} \approx 1,495.57
$$

So you’d need to invest about $1,495.57 today.
