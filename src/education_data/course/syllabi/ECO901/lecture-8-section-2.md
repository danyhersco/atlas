Fiscal policy operates chiefly through two levers:

### Government Spending

This encompasses all government expenditures on goods and services, including:
- Infrastructure (roads, bridges, public transportation)
- Health care and education
- Public safety and national defense
- Social programs (unemployment benefits, social security)

In macroeconomic terms, government spending ($G$) is a component of aggregate demand:
$$
AD = C + I + G + (X - M)
$$
Where:
- $C$ = consumption
- $I$ = investment
- $G$ = government spending
- $X$ = exports
- $M$ = imports

**Example:** If the economy slides into a recession, the government might increase spending on infrastructure projects. This not only creates jobs directly but may also have multiplier effects throughout the economy as workers spend their wages.

### Taxation

Taxation determines how much money households and businesses have available to spend or invest. Taxes may include:
- Direct taxes (income tax, corporate tax)
- Indirect taxes (sales tax, value-added tax)

A reduction in taxes increases disposable income ($Y_d$), stimulating consumption ($C$):
$$
Y_d = Y - T
$$
Where:
- $Y$ = total income
- $T$ = taxes

**Example:** Cutting payroll taxes during an economic downturn leaves households with more take-home pay, encouraging higher spending.

### The Fiscal Multiplier

The impact of government spending or taxation on national income is measured by the **fiscal multiplier**.

If $G$ increases by $1$, and the multiplier is $k$, total output increases by $k$ dollars:
$$
\Delta Y = k \Delta G
$$
The size of the multiplier depends on the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), tax rates, and other factors.
