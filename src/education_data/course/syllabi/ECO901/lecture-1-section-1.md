Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an entire economy, rather than individual markets. It focuses on aggregate indicators and the interactions between different sectors of the economy. Key domains include national income, overall output, unemployment, inflation, and growth.

**Some key questions in macroeconomics:**
- What determines the overall level of production in an economy?
- Why do economies grow over time?
- What causes economic recessions and expansions?
- How do policies like government spending and interest rates affect the economy?

### Example
Consider a country with millions of businesses and households. Microeconomics might examine how a single firm sets the price for its product, while macroeconomics is concerned with how all firms and households together determine the nation’s unemployment rate, total output, and price level.
