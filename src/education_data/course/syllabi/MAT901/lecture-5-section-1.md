In this lecture, we will explore some of the most frequently encountered probability distributions in statistics and applied sciences. By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- Recognize situations modeled by the Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Normal, and Uniform distributions.
- Understand properties, formulas, and parameters associated with each.
- Compute probabilities and expected values for each distribution.
- Relate real-world scenarios to appropriate probability models.
