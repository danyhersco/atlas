Not all unemployment is the same. Economists classify unemployment into several categories, each with different causes and implications.

### 1. Frictional Unemployment

**Definition:** Short-term unemployment that arises from the normal process of matching workers with jobs.

- **Causes:** Workers transitioning between jobs, recent graduates entering the labor force, people relocating.
- **Characteristics:** Usually considered inevitable and even desirable as it reflects labor mobility.

**Example:** A software developer voluntarily leaves her job to find one that better matches her skills.

### 2. Structural Unemployment

**Definition:** Unemployment due to a mismatch between workers’ skills and the requirements of the available jobs.

- **Causes:** Technological change, shifts in consumer demand, trade competition, changes in labor regulations.
- **Characteristics:** Usually longer-lasting and more problematic than frictional unemployment.

**Example:** Factory workers lose jobs when machines automate the production process, and they lack the skills to operate or maintain the new technology.

### 3. Cyclical Unemployment

**Definition:** Unemployment that arises from downturns in the business cycle — i.e., from a lack of aggregate demand.

- **Causes:** Recessions and economic slowdowns.
- **Characteristics:** Tied closely to the health of the economy; can rise or fall quickly as the economy contracts or expands.

**Example:** Restaurant servers are laid off during a recession when people cut back on dining out.

### 4. Seasonal Unemployment

**Definition:** Unemployment caused by seasonal fluctuations in demand for certain kinds of labor.

- **Example:** Agricultural workers may be unemployed during the off-season; retail employees may find their hours reduced after the holiday season.
