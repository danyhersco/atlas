Economic fluctuations, or "shocks," can be:

### Demand-Side Shocks

- Changes in consumer or business confidence.
- Government spending or taxation changes.
- Monetary policy changes (interest rates, money supply).

**Example:** The 2008 financial crisis began with a drop in consumer and business confidence, reinforced by contractionary credit conditions.

### Supply-Side Shocks

- Changes in the availability or price of resources (oil shocks).
- Technological advances or failures.
- Natural disasters.

**Example:** The oil crises of the 1970s led to higher production costs and stagflation (high inflation and stagnation).

### External Shocks

- International events, like wars, global pandemics, or foreign recessions.
- Changes in global demand/supply for key goods.
