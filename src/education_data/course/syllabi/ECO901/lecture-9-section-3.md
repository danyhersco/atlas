Central banks influence the **money supply**—the total amount of money available within an economy.

### Components of the Money Supply

Broadly, economists classify money into different categories:

- **M1**: Currency in circulation + demand deposits (checking accounts).
- **M2**: All of M1 + savings accounts, small time deposits, and other near monies.

Central banks keep close tabs on these measures to inform policy decisions.

### Tools to Control the Money Supply

Central banks use several **tools of monetary policy**:

1. **Open Market Operations (OMOs)**: Buying or selling government securities (like bonds) in the open market to control the amount of money circulating.
2. **Discount Rate**: The interest rate central banks charge commercial banks for short-term loans.
3. **Reserve Requirements**: The fraction of deposits that commercial banks must hold in reserve, rather than lend out.

Let’s see how each tool works.

#### Open Market Operations (OMOs)

**Most frequently used tool.**
- **Buying government bonds** increases the money supply (injects money into the economy).
- **Selling government bonds** decreases the money supply (withdraws money from the economy).

##### Example

Suppose the Fed wants to stimulate a sluggish economy. It buys $50 billion in government bonds from banks. This gives banks more cash to lend, leading to more loans and increased economic activity.

#### Discount Rate

- If the **discount rate is lowered**, borrowing from the central bank becomes cheaper, encouraging banks to lend more and increasing the money supply.
- If the **discount rate is raised**, bank loans become costlier, slowing down the expansion of the money supply.

#### Reserve Requirements

- **Lowering the reserve requirement** allows banks to lend a larger proportion of their deposits, expanding the money supply.
- **Raising the reserve requirement** restricts bank lending, contracting the money supply.

Modern central banks rarely use reserve requirements as a regular instrument, relying more on OMOs and interest rates.
