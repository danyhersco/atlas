Financial institutions play a central role in our financial system and in personal money management. Understanding their functions and differences is essential for making informed decisions about where to manage your money.

### 1. Commercial Banks
These are the most common type of financial institutions. Key features include:
- Accept deposits from individuals and businesses

### 2. Credit Unions
Credit unions are not-for-profit member-owned financial cooperatives.
- Membership is usually based on a common bond (e.g., employer, location, religious affiliation)

### 3. Online Banks and Neobanks
These banks operate entirely online, without physical branches.

*Example:* Ally Bank, Chime, SoFi
