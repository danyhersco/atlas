Understanding typical mistakes helps you avoid costly errors.

### 1. **Confusing Correlation and Causation**

Just because two variables move together does **not** mean one causes the other.

**Example:**
Ice cream sales and drowning incidents might both increase in summer—correlated, but ice cream does **not** cause drowning.

### 2. **Misunderstanding p-values**

- A p-value **does not** tell you the probability that the null hypothesis is true.
- A p-value of 0.04 means: "Assuming the null hypothesis is true, there's a 4% chance of observing a result at least as extreme as this."

### 3. **Ignoring the Sampling Method**

Non-random samples (e.g., surveys only reaching internet users) might not represent the population—introducing **sampling bias**.

### 4. **Cherry-picking or “p-hacking”**

Trying multiple analyses and only reporting the most favorable result can lead to false discoveries.

### 5. **Over-interpretation of Statistical Significance**

Statistically significant results may not be **practically** significant, especially with large samples.
