Let’s build a monthly budget for Erica, a college student:

**Step 1: Income**

- Parents' allowance: $300
- Part-time job: $600

**Total Income: $900**

**Step 2: Expenses**

| Expense        | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| Rent           | $350   |
| Groceries      | $140   |
| Phone          | $30    |
| Transportation | $40    |
| Subscriptions  | $20    |
| Entertainment  | $40    |
| Savings        | $100   |
| Total          | $720   |

**Step 3: Calculate Difference**

$900 - $720 = $180 left for emergencies or larger future goals

**Step 4: Set a Goal**

Erica decides to save $600 for a new laptop in 6 months: needs to save $100/month (already allocated above).

If expenses unexpectedly rise, Erica will need to revisit other categories or adjust her spending.
