An emergency fund is money set aside exclusively for unplanned expenses—never for daily spending or planned purchases.

### How Much is Enough?

A common rule is to save **3-6 months** of essential expenses.

- **Essential expenses:** Housing, utilities, food, insurance, transportation, minimum debt payments.
- The right amount depends on:
    - Job stability (freelancers/contractors may want more)
    - Family size
    - Health situation

**Example Calculation:**

If your monthly essentials are:

- Rent: $1,000
- Groceries: $300
- Utilities: $100
- Transportation: $200
- Insurance: $150

Total: $1,750/month

**Goal:** $1,750 * 3 months = $5,250  
Ideally, for 6 months: $1,750 * 6 = $10,500

### Steps to Build an Emergency Fund

1. **Set a Realistic Goal:** Start with $500 or $1,000 if full amount feels overwhelming.
2. **Separate Your Fund:** Use a dedicated savings account; avoid mixing with everyday accounts.
3. **Automate Savings:** Set up automatic transfers on payday.
4. **Start Small:** Even $10/week grows over time.
5. **Increase Contributions Gradually:** As income rises, so should savings.
6. **Use Only for True Emergencies:** Medical bills, job loss, essential home/car repairs.
