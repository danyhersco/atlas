Let's review the journey so far:

- **Probability** focused on quantifying uncertainty, from basic rules to advanced concepts like Bayes' theorem.
- **Statistics** centered on collecting data, summarizing (descriptive stats), and drawing inferences (inferential stats).
- **Random Variables and Distributions** gave us the language to model all sorts of real phenomena.
- **Sampling and Confidence Intervals** showed how we generalize from a sample to a population with measured uncertainty.
- **Hypothesis Testing** taught us a systematic approach for making and evaluating claims using data.

Key skills you should now have:

- Reason with probabilities and make predictions.
- Analyze data with an understanding of measures of center and spread.
- Choose and use probability distributions in real-world settings.
- Construct and interpret confidence intervals.
- Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests, including p-values and errors.

Above all: Statistics is both a toolbox for science and a filter for understanding information. Clear thinking about probability and statistics helps you make better decisions—even outside academia.
