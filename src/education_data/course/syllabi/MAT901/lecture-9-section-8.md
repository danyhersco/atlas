Suppose we want to test a claim about the proportion $p$ in a population.

#### Example: One-sample Z-test for Proportions

Let $p_0$ be the hypothesized proportion, $\hat{p}$ the sample proportion, and $n$ the sample size.

$$
Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{ p_0 (1-p_0) / n } }
$$

Use this test when samples are sufficiently large (rule of thumb: $n p_0 > 5$ and $n(1-p_0) > 5$).
