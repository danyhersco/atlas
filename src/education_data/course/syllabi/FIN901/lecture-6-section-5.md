If you are in debt, or considering taking on debt, you need a plan to manage it effectively.

### 1. Track and Prioritize Debt

List all debts: balance, interest rate, minimum payment. Prioritize either:
- **Highest interest rate first (avalanche method),** or
- **Smallest balance first (snowball method)** for psychological wins.

#### Debt Avalanche Example

- Card A: $2,000 at 18%
- Card B: $1,000 at 22%
- Loan C: $3,000 at 7%

Pay extra towards Card B (highest rate) while making minimums on others.

#### Debt Snowball Example

Pay off Card B first (smallest balance), then Card A, then Loan C.

### 2. Consolidate or Refinance

Combine debts into a single loan (often at a lower rate), making payments simpler and possibly saving on interest.

### 3. Negotiate with Creditors

Ask for lower interest, more time, or alternative payment arrangements.

### 4. Seek Professional Help

For overwhelming debt, consult a nonprofit credit counselor.
