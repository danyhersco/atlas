How do economists evaluate if policies “work”?

### Fiscal Policy

- **Short-run (Keynesian Cross, IS-LM):** Government spending increases can raise output and lower unemployment, especially when there is unused capacity.
- **Caveats:** Crowding out (higher G may lead to higher interest rates, discouraging I); lag times; political constraints.

### Monetary Policy

- **IS-LM and AD–AS Models:** Central bank actions (money supply, interest rates) directly move the LM curve or the AD curve.
- **Limitations:** Liquidity traps (when interest rates are near zero, monetary policy may be less effective).

### The Role of Expectations

- Modern extensions incorporate expectations; e.g., if people expect future inflation, policy can be less effective.

### Real-World Example

**The COVID-19 Recession (2020):**
- Governments enacted massive fiscal stimulus and unprecedented monetary policy easing (interest rates near or below zero, quantitative easing).
- Despite textbook predictions, inflation remained subdued for much of 2020-2021, challenging classic models.
