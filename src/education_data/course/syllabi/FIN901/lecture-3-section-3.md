### 1. List All Sources of Income

Start by identifying *all* sources of money you receive regularly (after taxes):

- Salary/wages from employment
- Side hustles or freelance work
- Student stipends/scholarships
- Investment income (interest, dividends)
- Gifts or allowances

**Example Table**:

| Source       | Monthly Amount |
|--------------|---------------|
| Job          | $1,500        |
| Freelance    | $300          |
| Investment   | $50           |
| **Total**    | **$1,850**    |

### 2. List and Categorize All Expenses

Break down your spending into various categories. Use the information from Lecture 2 as a reference between fixed, variable, and discretionary expenses.

**Common Categories**:
- Housing (rent, utilities)
- Food (groceries, dining out)
- Transportation (gas, transit passes)
- Insurance (health, car)
- Personal (clothing, entertainment)
- Savings and investments
- Debt repayment

**Example Table**:

| Expense Category | Monthly Amount |
|------------------|---------------|
| Rent             | $650          |
| Groceries        | $200          |
| Utilities        | $100          |
| Transportation   | $70           |
| Phone            | $30           |
| Entertainment    | $50           |
| Savings          | $400          |
| **Total**        | **$1,500**    |

### 3. Calculate the Difference

Subtract your total expenses from your total income:

$$
\text{Net Income} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses}
$$

- **Positive Net Income**: You are spending less than you earn—a good sign!
- **Negative Net Income**: Expenses exceed income—you need to adjust spending or increase income.

### 4. Set Your Financial Goals

Budgets should be linked to goals. These can be short-term (saving for a vacation), medium-term (buying a car), or long-term (retirement). Clear goals help prioritize where your money needs to go.

**Make your goals SMART:**  
- Specific  
- Measurable  
- Achievable  
- Relevant  
- Time-bound

**Example**:
- Save $3000 for a trip in 12 months ($250/month).
- Pay off $600 in credit card debt in 6 months ($100/month).

### 5. Make Adjustments

If your planned expenses and savings do not fit within your income, revisit each category:
- Can you reduce discretionary spending?
- Could you increase your income?
- Should you adjust your goals?

Iterate until your budget is realistic and achievable.
