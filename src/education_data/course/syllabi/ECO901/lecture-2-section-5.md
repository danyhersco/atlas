National income accounting involves other indicators that provide a fuller picture of economic activity:

### 1. **Personal Income (PI)**

- Total income received by households (before taxes).

### 2. **Disposable Personal Income (DPI)**

- Personal income minus personal taxes; income available for spending or saving.

### 3. **Gross National Income (GNI)**

- Similar to GNP, but used in international statistics.

**Hierarchy Recap:**
- GDP → GNP → NNP → NI → PI → DPI
