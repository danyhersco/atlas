**Estimate Your Retirement Needs**

Imagine your ideal retirement, and estimate:

- The age you hope to retire.
- The annual income (in today's dollars) you would like during retirement.
- How much income you expect from non-savings sources (e.g., social security, pensions).
- The total amount you’d need saved up by retirement to safely withdraw 4% per year (using the $4%$ rule).
- Your plan to reach this amount (e.g., how much to save per month over X years, assuming a given interest rate).
