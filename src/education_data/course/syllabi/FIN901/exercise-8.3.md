**Spotting Financial Pitfalls**

Review your last month’s spending (real or hypothetical). Identify two areas where you may have fallen into a common financial pitfall (e.g., impulse buying, neglecting savings, accumulating debt). Write a short paragraph for each, explaining what happened and how you could avoid those pitfalls in the future.
