A government, facing a national emergency, passes a law allowing for temporary suspension of certain civil liberties (e.g., right to assemble, freedom of the press). 

- Discuss, with reference to principles from past cases, how courts might assess the constitutionality of such a law.
- What factors would influence judicial decision-making in this context?
