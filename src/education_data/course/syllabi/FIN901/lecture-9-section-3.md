### The Rise of Digital Banking

With the advance of technology, traditional banking has been disrupted by new players:

- **Online-only banks (Neobanks)**: These operate without branches and are focused on efficiency and technology.
- **Fintech companies**: "Financial Technology" companies leverage software to deliver financial services directly to consumers.

**Key Advantages:**
- Lower fees and better interest rates due to reduced overhead
- Faster account opening and loan approvals
- Tools for budgeting, savings, and expense tracking
- Customer support via chat and apps

**Potential Disadvantages:**
- No physical locations (challenging for those who need in-person service)
- Reliance on technology and internet connectivity
- Security and privacy concerns

**Innovations in Banking Apps:**
- Automated savings: Set rules to transfer money to savings accounts automatically
- Spending analysis: Categorize expenses and visualize spending patterns
- Credit score monitoring
- Peer-to-peer payments (Venmo, Cash App, Zelle)
