### Sources of Public Law:
- **Constitutions** (written or unwritten): Set out fundamental rules for how a country is governed.
- **Statutes:** Laws passed by legislatures.
- **Regulations:** Detailed rules made by government agencies.
- **Case law:** Judicial decisions that interpret constitutions, statutes, and regulations.

### The Dynamic Nature of Public Law

Public law is not static:
- Responds to evolving social values and political developments.
- Subject to interpretation and debate.
- A site for tension between stability (order) and change (reform, social justice).

**Example:**
The status of same-sex marriage and subsequent constitutional changes in multiple countries reflect the dynamic interaction between law, society, and politics.
