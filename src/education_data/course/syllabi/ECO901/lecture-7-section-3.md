Economic growth is influenced by several broad factors:

### 1. Physical Capital Accumulation

**Physical capital** refers to the stock of equipment, machinery, buildings, and infrastructure available to produce goods and services. Increased investment in capital (e.g., building new factories, purchasing machines) increases the capacity for production.

- **Capital deepening:** Increasing the amount of capital per worker, often leading to higher productivity.

### 2. Human Capital

**Human capital** is the knowledge, skills, and health that workers bring to production. Investment in education, training, and healthcare leads to a more skilled and productive workforce.

**Examples:**
- Public education systems
- On-the-job training
- Better nutrition and healthcare

### 3. Technological Progress

Technological progress refers to improvements in how resources are combined to produce output, often through innovation or adoption of better methods and tools. This is seen as the engine of long-term growth.

- **Examples:**
  - Development of new machinery (e.g., computers, automation)
  - Improved organizational methods (e.g., assembly line production)
  - Advances in digital technology

### 4. Institutional Factors

Institutions—such as property rights, rule of law, political stability, and efficient markets—create incentives and conditions that support investment, innovation, and efficient allocation of resources.

**Examples:**
- Effective contract enforcement encourages investment.
- Stable monetary policy reduces uncertainty.

### 5. Natural Resources

While the presence of abundant natural resources (oil, minerals, fertile land) can support growth, they are not a guarantee of development. How resources are managed and utilized is crucial.

**Caution:** Some countries with many resources still experience low growth due to poor governance or lack of diversification (the "resource curse").

### 6. Openness to Trade

Economies that are open to international trade can benefit from larger markets, increased competition, technology transfer, and access to capital.
