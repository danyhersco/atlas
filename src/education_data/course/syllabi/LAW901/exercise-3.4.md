**Interpretation Scenario:**

Suppose a constitution states: "All persons shall have the right to privacy in their communications." Analyze and discuss:
- Does this guarantee apply to emails and instant messages, which did not exist at the time the constitution was written?
- Should courts interpret "communications" strictly (to include only methods known at the time), or broadly? Present your reasoning.

This concludes Lecture 3. In the next session, we will explore more about how constitutions shape the daily workings of governments and citizens alike. Remember, constitutions are not just static documents, but living frameworks guiding the balance between authority and liberty in society.
