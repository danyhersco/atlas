**Risk** is the possibility that an adverse event will impact your financial well-being. All financial decisions carry some degree of risk, whether it's losing a job, facing a health emergency, or something as dramatic as a natural disaster.

**Risk Management** is the process of identifying, assessing, and taking steps to minimize or handle risks.

### Steps in Personal Risk Management

1. **Identify Potential Risks**
   - Examples: Job loss, medical emergencies, disability, theft, accidents, natural disasters.

2. **Assess the Severity and Likelihood**
   - Which risks would have the biggest impact?
   - How likely are these events?

3. **Develop Strategies to Address Risks**
   - Avoidance: Not engaging in risky behavior (e.g., not smoking).
   - Reduction: Taking measures to lessen risk (e.g., healthy lifestyle to prevent illness).
   - Transfer: Shifting risk to another entity (e.g., buying insurance).
   - Acceptance: Recognizing and preparing to bear necessary risks (e.g., minor repairs).

### Example: Jane’s Approach to Risk Management

Jane is worried about medical expenses, losing her job, and her house flooding. She:
- Gets health insurance (risk transfer for medical expenses).
- Builds an emergency fund (prepares for job loss).
- Buys flood insurance and stores valuables on higher floors (risk transfer and reduction regarding flooding).
