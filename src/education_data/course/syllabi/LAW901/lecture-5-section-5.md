### Why Does Judicial Independence Matter?

For courts to fulfill their constitutional mandate—interpreting the law impartially and protecting rights—they must be independent of external pressures (political, economic, or social).

**Key aspects of judicial independence:**
- **Security of tenure:** Judges cannot be removed arbitrarily.
- **Financial autonomy:** Salaries and budgets are protected from manipulation.
- **Appointment processes:** Mechanisms exist to prevent politicized or biased judicial appointments.

### Threats to Judicial Independence

- Executive interference (e.g., appointment or removal of judges based on loyalty)
- Manipulation of court budgets
- Intimidation or retaliation against judges
- Public campaigns undermining judicial legitimacy

**Judicial independence is not just about protecting judges; it is about ensuring justice for the public.** When judges are free from coercion, the public can trust their decisions to be fair and just.
