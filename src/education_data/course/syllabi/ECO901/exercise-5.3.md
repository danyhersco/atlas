*A numerical problem:*

Suppose the economy’s AD is given by:
$$
Y = 12,000 - 300P
$$
And the SRAS is:
$$
Y = 2,000 + 200P
$$
Where $Y$ is real output and $P$ is the price level.

1. Solve for the short-run equilibrium output and price level.
2. If potential output is $Y^* = 7,000$, does the economy have an output gap? Is it inflationary or recessionary?
