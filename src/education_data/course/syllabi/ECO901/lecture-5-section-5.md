### Shifts in Aggregate Demand

- **Expansionary AD Shift (Right):**
    - Causes: Lower taxes, more government spending, increased investment or exports.
    - Result (Short-Run): Higher output ($Y$), higher price level ($P$), possible positive output gap.

- **Contractionary AD Shift (Left):**
    - Causes: Higher taxes, less government spending, decreased private investment.
    - Result: Lower output and price level, possible recessionary gap.

### Shifts in Aggregate Supply

- **SRAS Shifts Right:** 
    - Causes: Lower input costs (like oil prices), improved productivity.
    - Result: Higher output, lower price level.

- **SRAS Shifts Left (Adverse Supply Shock):**
    - Causes: Natural disasters, higher wage costs, higher raw material prices.
    - Result: Lower output, higher price level (stagflation).

### Illustrating Shocks with Diagrams

Let's look at **expansionary fiscal policy**:
- Government boosts spending.
- AD shifts right.
- Output rises above potential.
- Price level increases.

Now consider a **negative supply shock**:
- Oil prices spike.
- SRAS shifts left.
- Output falls, price level rises (stagflation).
