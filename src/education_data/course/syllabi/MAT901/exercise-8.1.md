Suppose you draw a random sample of $n=36$ battery lifetimes from a normal population with unknown standard deviation. You calculate the sample mean lifetime as $120$ hours and the standard deviation as $12$ hours.

**Task:**
1. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean battery lifetime.
2. Explain (in words) what this confidence interval means.
