### Finding Equilibrium

Equilibrium occurs where AD intersects with AS. 

- **Short-Run Equilibrium:** Where AD meets SRAS. May be above or below potential output.
- **Long-Run Equilibrium:** Where AD, SRAS, and LRAS intersect at the same point—output is at its potential.

**Graphical Representation:**

- **$Y^*$:** Potential (full-employment) output
- **$P_e$:** Equilibrium price level

### Output Gaps

- **Recessionary (Negative) Gap:** If equilibrium output is below potential, unemployment is high.
- **Inflationary (Positive) Gap:** If equilibrium is above potential, output is unsustainably high, and inflation pressures build up.
