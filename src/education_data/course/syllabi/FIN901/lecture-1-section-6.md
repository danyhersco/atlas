Developing good financial habits is essential for long-term financial health. Here are some core practices:

- **Track your spending:** Use a notebook, spreadsheet, or app.
- **Save consistently:** Even small, regular contributions add up over time.
- **Read financial documents:** Before signing anything, understand the terms.
- **Ask questions:** Don’t be afraid to seek help or information from credible sources.
