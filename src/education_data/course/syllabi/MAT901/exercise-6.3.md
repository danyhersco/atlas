Suppose you have a new dataset of employee salaries at a company:  
[30000, 32000, 34000, 35000, 37000, 39000, 120000]

a) Compute mean and median.  
b) Explain why the mean is not representative of the "typical" salary in this case.  
c) Which measure—mean or median—would you report as a summary of the typical salary? Why?
