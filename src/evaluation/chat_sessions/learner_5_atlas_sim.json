In Python, we assign values to variables in a similar way, but we have more flexibility and some important conventions. For example:\n\n```python\nv0 = 5\ng = 9.81\nt = 0.6\ny = v0 * t - 0.5 * g * t**2\nprint(y)\n```\n\nYou did something just like this for the height formula—but did you notice the names? In programming, it’s often better to use descriptive names, especially in longer programs. For example:\n\n```python\ninitial_velocity = 5\nacceleration_of_gravity = 9.81\ntime = 0.6\nvertical_position_of_ball = (\n    initial_velocity * time - 0.5 * acceleration_of_gravity * time**2\n)\nprint(vertical_position_of_ball)\n```\n\nLet’s pause for a moment:\n\n1. Looking at the two versions above, which style of variable name do you find more readable for a longer program—and why?\n2. Based on what you see, what do you think are some rules or restrictions on what you can use as a variable name in Python? \n\nTry answering both—reason it out and I’ll fill in any gaps!"

Also, maybe you can’t start a variable name with a number? I’m not sure about other things, like using special characters or upper/lower case. Are all those allowed?"

You're spot on that descriptive names like `initial_velocity` make code easier to understand, especially as programs grow.\n\nFor your guesses about the rules:\n- You are absolutely right: spaces are not allowed in variable names, which is why we use underscores (`_`).\n- Variable names cannot start with a number—again, correct!\n\nLet’s dig a bit deeper:\n- What do you think happens if you use uppercase letters, like `Velocity` or `VELOCITY`? Are they different from `velocity` in Python?\n- Can you use symbols such as `-`, `!`, or `@` in a variable name?\n\nWhy don’t you try to predict—before running any code—what will happen with these three example variable names:\n\n1. `my_var`\n2. `2nd_value`\n3. `user-name`\n\nWhich of these would be accepted as a variable name in Python, and which would cause an error?

Now we’re moving on to the topic of Code Comments in Python.\n\nWhen you look at code, not every line is meant for the computer to run—sometimes, it’s just for you (or other humans) to understand what’s happening. In Python, you create a comment by writing a # character: anything after that on the same line is ignored by Python.\n\nHere’s a quick example:\n\n```python\n# Program for computing the height of a ball in vertical motion.\nv0 = 5  # Set initial velocity in m/s.\ng = 9.81  # Set acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2.\nt = 0.6  # Time at which we want to know the height of the ball in seconds.\ny = v0 * t - 0.5 * g * t**2  # Calculate the vertical position.\nprint(y)\n```\n\nTake a look at this example.

Understanding how functions like `sin`, `cos`, and `log` work in Python—especially with parentheses—is super important, and a common place for confusion.\n\nLet’s explore one together!\n\nSuppose you want to compute $\\sin(1.2)$ and $\\ln(1.2)$ (ln = natural logarithm, which is `math.log` in Python).\n\nIn Python, you need to:\n1. Import the math module.\n2. Call the function with its argument inside parentheses.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nx = 1.2\nsine_value = math.sin(x)    # Calculates sin(1.2)\nlog_value = math.log(x)     # Calculates ln(1.2)\nprint(\"sin(1.2):\", sine_value)\nprint(\"ln(1.2):\", log_value)\n```\n\nNotice:\n- The `()` after `sin` or `log` are for the input—just like $f(x)$ in math.\n- You must write the argument inside the parentheses: `math.sin(x)`, not `math.sin x`.\n- Python's `sin` and `cos` expect the angle in **radians** (not degrees!).\n- `math.log(x)` gives you the natural log, $\\ln{x}$ (base $e$).\n\nWould you like to try writing a small line of code yourself to compute something like $\\sin(2)$ or $\\log(5)$?

For $\\sin$, always use radians\n\n- For `math.sin(x)`, $x$ must be in **radians**.\n- If you have degrees, convert first: `math.sin(math.radians(degree_value))`\n\nSo:\n```python\nprint(math.sin(2))         # 2 radians\nprint(math.sin(math.pi))   # pi radians (should be close to zero)\n```\nIf you wanted $\\sin(90^\\circ)$:\n```python\nprint(math.sin(math.radians(90)))  # converts 90 degrees to radians, then computes sin\n```\n\nWant to try writing code for $\\log_{10}(1000)$ and $\\sin(30^\\circ)$ in Python?

You’ve shown you can:\n- Import and use math functions\n- Translate math formulas into correct Python code\n- Carefully check order of operations\n\nThat meets our goal for standard mathematical functions in Python.  \nReady to move on to defining and using your own functions?

Your curiosity and careful thinking will really help as you dive into writing your own functions.\n\nLet’s start with the basics:  \n- Can you explain, in your own words, why someone might want to use a function instead of just writing all their code line by line? What are some reasons functions are useful?\n\nAnd, to get your hands on some real code:  \nImagine we wanted a Python function that calculates and returns the height of a ball launched upwards, at a velocity v0, after a certain time t passes (ignoring air resistance).  \nThe formula is:  \n\\[\nh = v_0 t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\n\\]\n\nWhat would the *function header* (the line that starts with `def`) look like for this in Python?

You’ve correctly used:\n- `def` to indicate it’s a function,\n- a descriptive function name (`height` is good, though more specific like `ball_height` can be handy), and\n- parameters for the values we’ll need: `v0`, `t`, `g`.\n\nHere’s the question: in the example code, the function defaulted gravity to $9.81$ if it wasn’t specified. Do you recall how Python lets you give a default value to a parameter—so you don’t have to always specify it? If so, how would you set $g$ to default to $9.81$ in your header?"

But if you ever need a different gravity (say, on Mars!), you can still provide `g`:\n\n```python\nheight(5, 1.2, 3.71)\n```\n\nNow, let’s put this together:\n- Write out the full function body so it uses that formula ($h = v_0 t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2$)\n- And have it return the computed height\n\nWhat would your complete Python function look like?

Here’s what will really happen:\n1. `change_x()` runs: It creates a local `x` inside the function and prints it—so the first print is 5.\n2. After the function, `print(x)` prints the global `x`, which is still 10.\n\nTry to summarize why the *global* `x` isn't changed. What part of the concept helps explain this?"

The \"not\"s can definitely be sneaky, but your process—breaking each bit apart, working through parentheses, and patiently evaluating each section—was spot on.\n\nIf you keep using this systematic approach, you’ll be able to handle even the most nested boolean expressions in Python. \n\nWould you like to try one more, or are you ready to move on to the next topic: loops in Python?"

You could do this:\n\n```python\nC = -20\nF = 9 / 5 * C + 32\nprint(C, F)\nC = -15\nF = 9 / 5 * C + 32\nprint(C, F)\n# ... and so on ...\n```\n\nBut as you can see, this quickly gets boring, repetitive, and easy to mess up if you do it many times! When you notice you’re doing the same thing over and over, programming usually has a smarter way: a loop.\n\nLet’s warm up:  \nWhy do you think programmers prefer to use loops instead of copy-pasting the same code many times?

A loop doesn’t really make your computer magically “work faster” in terms of raw processing. But here’s something cool: using loops can sometimes make the underlying program smaller and use less memory, because the instructions aren’t all copy-pasted into a huge file—they’re more compact and organized.\n\nBefore we move to how loops are written, let’s make sure you’re comfortable with the idea:\n\nCan you explain, in your own words, what sort of task would make you think, “Yes, I need a loop here!”?

Here’s an example—take the common approach of constructing a list using a loop:\n\n```python\nCdegrees = []\nfor i in range(16):\n    Cdegrees.append(-5 + i * 0.5)\n```\n\nUsing a list comprehension, you could write the same thing as:\n```python\nCdegrees = [-5 + i * 0.5 for i in range(16)]\n```\n\nIt’s much more concise, right? The general pattern is:\n\n```python\nnew_list = [expression for variable in iterable if condition]\n```\n(The `if condition` part is optional.)\n\nLet’s warm up:\nSuppose you want a list of all squares of integers from 0 to 9, i.e., `[0, 1, 4, 9, ..., 81]`.\n\nHow would you write a list comprehension to generate this list? Give it a try!"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Um, okay... I think I would write:  \n`squares = [i * i for i in range(10)]`  \n\nIs that right? Or should I use `**` instead of `*`?"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Excellent, Ethan! Your approach is exactly right—and both $i * i$ and $i ** 2$ will work the same way in this context.\n\nSo, either of these will produce the list of squares from 0 to 9:\n\n```python\nsquares = [i * i for i in range(10)]\n# or\nsquares = [i ** 2 for i in range(10)]\n```\n\nLet’s practice another pattern!\n\nSuppose you only want squares of even numbers from 0 to 9. What changes would you make to your list comprehension to filter for even $i$?"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Um, I'm not totally sure, but maybe I can add an `if`? Maybe like this:  \n`squares = [i * i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0]`\n\nIs that how you do it?"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Perfect, Ethan! That’s exactly how you do it.\n\nThe `if i % 2 == 0` filters the list so that your expression only applies to even values of $i$ in `range(10)`. \n\nSo your comprehension:\n\n```python\nsquares = [i * i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0]\n```\nproduces: `[0, 4, 16, 36, 64]`\n\nNice work!  \nNow, sometimes you want to generate a list based on an existing list rather than a range. For example, if you have:\n\n```python\ntemps_celsius = [0, 10, 20, 30]\n```\nHow could you use a list comprehension to make a new list, converting each element to Fahrenheit with the formula $F = (9/5)C + 32$? (Let’s see how you’d write that!)"

        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Okay, I think I would do:  \n`temps_fahrenheit = [9/5 * C + 32 for C in temps_celsius]`  \n\nIs that right? Or do I need parentheses around `9/5 * C`?"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Great question! Your syntax is spot-on, and in this case, parentheses aren’t strictly necessary—Python’s operator precedence will handle multiplication before addition. But, adding parentheses can make the formula clearer and is never a bad idea:\n\n```python\ntemps_fahrenheit = [(9/5) * C + 32 for C in temps_celsius]\n```\n\nBoth forms will work, but this one emphasizes the formula’s structure.\n\nReady for something a little more creative? Imagine you have a list:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [7, 2, 5, 13]\n```\n\nWrite a list comprehension to produce a new list called `doubled` that contains each number from `numbers` multiplied by 2. What would you type?"

            "role": "user",

        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Yes, Ethan! That’s exactly the right way to do it.\n\n```python\ndoubled = [n * 2 for n in numbers]\n```\n\nThis will take each value in `numbers` and create a new list with each value doubled.\n\nYou’ve really grasped the basic pattern of list comprehensions! Now, are you ready to try a multi-step challenge using list comprehensions? Let’s break it down step by step for the π (pi) calculation from the Gregory-Leibniz series.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nProduce a list of the first $n$ odd numbers, for example, when $n = 5$, you want `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.\n\nHow would you use a list comprehension to produce that list given some `n`? Give it a try—for now, just this step!"

            "role": "user",
            "content": "Um, I think I should use `range`, but I’m not sure how to get just odd numbers. Maybe like:\n\n`odd_numbers = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if i % 2 != 0]`\n\nIs that correct?"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "That’s a good approach, Ethan! Your code will indeed generate a list of odd numbers from 1 up to $n$ (as long as $n$ is included if it’s odd), filtering using `i % 2 != 0`. \n\nBut for this particular step, we want exactly the first $n$ odd numbers—not all odds up to $n$. For example, if $n=5$, we want `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are the first $5$ odd numbers, not just all odds less than or equal to $n$.\n\nCan you think of a way to produce the $k^{th}$ odd number using just the index $k$ (starting from 0)? That way, with a single list comprehension over `range(n)`, you’d get those $n$ numbers directly.\n\nHint: What expression gives the sequence $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \\ldots$ as $k$ goes from $0$ to $n-1$?"

            "content": "Oh, I see! So maybe the $k^{th}$ odd number could be written as $2k + 1$.\n\nSo should I write:  \n`odd_numbers = [2*k + 1 for k in range(n)]`  \n\nWould that give the first $n$ odd numbers?"
        },

            "content": "Exactly right, Ethan!  \n`odd_numbers = [2*k + 1 for k in range(n)]`  \nwill give you a list of the first $n$ odd numbers: $[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...]$.\n\nGreat job figuring out the pattern!\n\nLet’s move on to **Step 2** of building the list comprehension for the Gregory-Leibniz series:\n\nWe need to create a list of signs: $[1, -1, 1, -1, \\ldots]$ for each term in the sequence.  \nCan you think of a neat mathematical expression—using $k$—that alternates between $1$ and $-1$ as $k$ increases? (Think about what $(-1)^k$ does for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.)  \nHow would you build the list of signs for $n$ terms using a comprehension?"

            "role": "user",
            "content": "Um, I think $(-1)^k$ does alternate between $1$ and $-1$. So, maybe I could do:\n\n`signs = [(-1)**k for k in range(n)]`\n\nWould that make the sequence alternate like $1, -1, 1, -1, \\ldots$ for each term?"

The pattern involves dividing each `sign` by the corresponding `odd_number`. (Hint: the operation you want for each term is `signs[k] / odd_numbers[k]` for each $k$ in `range(n)`.)\n\nHow might you write that as a list comprehension?"

            "content": "That’s a great instinct! Your approach using `[signs[k] / odd_numbers[k] for k in range(n)]` works perfectly, since the lists are index-aligned, and you’re iterating over their indices.\n\nAlternatively, as you suspected, you can use `zip` to pair up elements if you ever want to avoid direct indexing. That would look like:\n\n```python\nterms = [s / o for (s, o) in zip(signs, odd_numbers)]\n```\n\nBoth methods give the same result for this case, so you can choose whichever you find more readable.\n\nNice work! Now, for the final **Step 4**:  \nAdd up all the values in your `terms` list, multiply the result by 4 (per the formula), and return that as your estimate for $\\pi$.\n\n- If you already have a custom sum function (like `my_sum`), use that.\n- Otherwise, you can use Python’s built-in `sum()`.\n\nCan you write out the function `calculate_pi(n)` following these steps? Give it a try—write the function definition as if you were submitting your code!"
