### What is a p-value?

- The p-value is the probability, under $H_0$, of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one actually observed.
- A low p-value indicates that the observed data are unlikely under $H_0$.

### Making Decisions

- **If $p$-value $< \alpha$:** Reject $H_0$ (statistically significant result).
- **If $p$-value $\geq \alpha$:** Do not reject $H_0$.

#### Typical $\alpha$ values:

- 0.05 (5%)
- 0.01 (1%)
- 0.10 (10%)

**Example:** If you compute a p-value of 0.03 and $\alpha = 0.05$, you reject the null hypothesis because $0.03 < 0.05$.
