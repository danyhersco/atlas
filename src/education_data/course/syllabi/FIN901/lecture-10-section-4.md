Planning for retirement is a crucial way to *build* financial security for your later years. It involves saving and investing so you can maintain your lifestyle after you stop working.

### Key Concepts

- **Start Early:** The earlier you start, the more you benefit from compounding returns.
- **Retirement Accounts:** Special accounts that offer tax advantages (e.g., 401(k), IRA in the US).
- **Employer-Sponsored Plans:** Many companies offer retirement savings plans with possible matching contributions.

### Steps for Retirement Planning

1. **Set Retirement Goals**
   - When do you want to retire?
   - What kind of lifestyle do you want?
2. **Estimate Your Needs**
   - How much income will you need per year?
   - Factor in inflation and healthcare expenses.
3. **Calculate the Gap**
   - How much can you expect from pensions, social security, or other sources?
   - How much do you still need to save?
4. **Pick Investment Vehicles**
   - Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, annuities, etc.
5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Rebalance your portfolio as needed.

#### Example Calculation

Suppose you want $40,000 per year in retirement income for 25 years, and you expect to receive $20,000 per year from social security:

- Total funds needed: 25 * ($40,000 - $20,000) = $500,000
- Assuming a 4% withdrawal rate, you’d need approximately: $500,000 / 0.04 = $1,250,000 saved (factoring in portfolio withdrawals and growth).
