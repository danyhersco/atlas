Inflation affects the interpretation of economic data over time.

- **Nominal value**: The monetary figure measured in current dollars.
- **Real value**: Adjusted for inflation; shows value in terms of purchasing power of a base year.

**Adjustment Formula**:
$$
\text{Real Value (in base-year dollars)} = \frac{\text{Nominal Value}}{\text{CPI Index/100}}
$$

**Example**:  
If your salary in 2023 is \$52,000 and $CPI_{2023} = 130$, then your real salary in base-year dollars is:
$$
\text{Real Salary} = \frac{52,000}{130/100} = \$40,000
$$
