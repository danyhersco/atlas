After learning how to manage your budget, savings, and the impact of interest rates, it is time to look at the next step in building financial security: investing.

**Why should people invest?**

1. **Grow Wealth Over Time:** Investments have the potential to provide greater returns than traditional savings accounts, helping your money grow.
2. **Beating Inflation:** If your money just sits in a low-interest savings account, inflation can reduce its real value each year. Investments often (but not always) outpace inflation.
3. **Future Goals:** Investing can help you achieve financial objectives, such as buying a house, supporting education, or planning for retirement.
4. **Income Generation:** Certain investments, such as bonds and dividend-paying stocks, provide regular income in addition to potential capital growth.

**Key Idea:** Investing is a way of putting your money to work, letting it generate more money without your continuous involvement.
