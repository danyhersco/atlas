### Limitations of GDP

While GDP is an important and widely used measure, it has several limitations when used to assess economic well-being:

1. **Excludes Non-Market Activities**  
   Household production, volunteer work, and informal economies are not measured.

2. **Ignores Distribution of Income**  
   GDP per capita does not reveal income inequality.

3. **No Account of Environmental Degradation**  
   Resource depletion and environmental harm are not subtracted from GDP.

4. **Overlooks Leisure and Quality of Life**  
   Hours worked, free time, safety, and other aspects affecting well-being are not captured.

5. **Excludes Non-Recorded or Illegal Activities**  
   Shadow economies or black markets are not included.

**Illustration:**  
If an oil spill raises cleanup spending, GDP rises, even though overall well-being may fall.

### Alternative and Complementary Measures

To address these weaknesses, economists have proposed alternative indicators:

#### 1. **Gross National Product (GNP)**

- Measures total income earned by a country's residents, regardless of production location.
- Includes income from abroad, excludes income generated by foreigners domestically.

#### 2. **Net National Product (NNP) and National Income (NI)**

- NNP = GNP minus depreciation (wear and tear on capital).
- NI = NNP minus indirect taxes plus subsidies.

#### 3. **GDP per Capita**

- GDP divided by population.
- Useful for comparing living standards between countries.

#### 4. **Human Development Index (HDI)**

- Composite index developed by the United Nations.
- Combines indicators of income (GNI per capita), education, and life expectancy.

#### 5. **Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)**

- Adjusts GDP by incorporating factors like income distribution, value of household and volunteer work, and costs of pollution and crime.

#### 6. **Green GDP**

- Adjusts GDP for environmental degradation and resource depletion.
