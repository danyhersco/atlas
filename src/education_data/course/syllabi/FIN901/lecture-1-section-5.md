Financial literacy has become increasingly important in a complex and fast-changing world:

- **Globalization:** More people have access to financial markets and products than ever before.
- **Digital Finance:** Online banking, digital wallets, and investment apps have made managing money easier—and riskier.
- **Social Trends:** Longer life expectancies and less predictable employment require more personal responsibility for financial well-being.

**Current Fact:**  
Research from various countries shows a widespread lack of understanding of basic financial concepts among adults. For example, surveys consistently show that less than half of adults can correctly answer questions about interest rates, inflation, and risk diversification.
