**Data Analysis:**  
Below is a simplified table of quarterly GDP growth rates for a hypothetical country:

| Quarter | GDP Growth Rate (%) |
|---------|--------------------|
| Q1      | 1.2                |
| Q2      | 1.5                |
| Q3      | 0.5                |
| Q4      | -0.8               |
| Q5      | -1.1               |
| Q6      | 0.2                |
| Q7      | 1.0                |

(a) Identify the expansion, peak, recession, and trough in this cycle.  
(b) Draw a line graph of GDP over the quarters and label the phases of the business cycle.
