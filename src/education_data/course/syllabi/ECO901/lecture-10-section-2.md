### 1. The Keynesian Cross

The Keynesian Cross is a simple model to explain equilibrium output (GDP) in the short run via aggregate expenditure. It highlights how changes in spending can have multiplied effects on total income.

#### Key Features

- *Aggregate Expenditure (AE)* is the sum of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.
- Equilibrium GDP is at the intersection where AE = output (Y).

#### Graphical Representation

Imagine a graph with output (Y) on the x-axis and expenditure on the y-axis.
- The 45-degree line represents points where AE = Y.
- The AE curve’s intersection with the 45-degree line gives the equilibrium output.

#### Example

Suppose:
- $C = 200 + 0.6Y$ (consumption function)
- $I = 100$ (investment)
- $G = 150$ (government spending)
- $NX = 50$ (net exports)

Aggregate Expenditure:

$$
AE = C + I + G + NX = 200 + 0.6Y + 100 + 150 + 50 = 500 + 0.6Y
$$

At equilibrium: $Y = AE$

$$
Y = 500 + 0.6Y \implies 0.4Y = 500 \implies Y^* = 1250
$$

### 2. The IS-LM Model

The IS-LM model introduces the financial sector by linking goods and money markets.

- **IS Curve:** Equilibrium in the goods market (Investment-Saving)
- **LM Curve:** Equilibrium in the money market (Liquidity preference-Money supply)

#### Graphical Representation

- The IS curve is downward sloping (higher interest rates reduce investment, reducing output).
- The LM curve is upward sloping (higher income increases demand for money, raising interest rates).
- The intersection gives equilibrium interest rates and output.

#### Policy Analysis

- Fiscal expansion (increased G or reduced taxes): IS shifts right, higher output and interest rate.
- Monetary expansion (increased money supply): LM shifts right, lower interest rate, higher output.

### 3. Aggregate Demand–Aggregate Supply (AD–AS) Model Review

Recall from Lecture 5:
- The AD–AS model considers both price level and output.
- AD curve: Total demand at various price levels.
- AS curve: Total supply at various price levels (with short-run and long-run distinctions).

**Use Cases**
- Analyzing inflation-unemployment tradeoffs.
- Understanding responses to “shocks” (oil prices, policies).

### 4. The Solow Growth Model

Primarily a long-run model, the Solow model explains economic growth by:
- Capital accumulation
- Labor force growth
- Technological progress

**Key Equation:**

$$
Y = F(K, L)
$$

Where $Y$ is output, $K$ is capital, $L$ is labor.

The model predicts that, in the absence of technological progress, economies converge to a steady-state growth path.
