The average lifespan of a particular brand of tire is claimed to be 40,000 km. A quality control manager takes a sample of 25 tires, finding a sample mean of 38,500 km and a sample standard deviation of 3,000 km.

a. State the null and alternative hypotheses to test if the mean lifespan differs from 40,000 km.

b. Compute the test statistic.

c. At a significance level of 0.05, and assuming a two-tailed test, what is your decision? (Use $t$-table or calculator as needed.)
