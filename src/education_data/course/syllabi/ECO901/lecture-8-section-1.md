**Fiscal policy** refers to the use of government spending and taxation to influence a country's economic activity. It is one of the primary tools, alongside monetary policy, that governments use to steer the economy toward desired objectives such as full employment, price stability, and economic growth.

There are two main types of fiscal policy:
- **Expansionary fiscal policy**: Increases aggregate demand through higher government spending or lower taxes, typically employed during recessions.
- **Contractionary fiscal policy**: Decreases aggregate demand by reducing government spending or increasing taxes, usually adopted to combat inflation.

Fiscal policy decisions are typically made through the governmental budget process and are implemented via changes to spending programs and tax regulations.
