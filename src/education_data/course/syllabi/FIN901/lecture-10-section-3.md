Insurance is a key tool for risk transfer. An **insurance policy** is a contract in which you pay premiums in exchange for the promise that the insurer will cover specific financial losses according to the terms of the policy.

### Common Types of Insurance

- **Health Insurance**: Covers medical expenses.
- **Auto Insurance**: Covers damage to cars and liability for accidents.
- **Homeowners or Renters Insurance**: Covers property loss and liability.
- **Life Insurance**: Provides financial support to dependents upon your death.
- **Disability Insurance**: Provides income if you’re unable to work due to illness or injury.

### How Insurance Works

1. You pay a **premium** (a regular payment).
2. If a covered event occurs, you file a **claim**.
3. The insurer pays out, possibly after a **deductible** (an initial amount you pay before coverage starts).

#### Example: Car Insurance

Suppose your annual premium for car insurance is $600, with a $500 deductible. If you get into an accident causing $2,500 in damages, you pay the first $500, and insurance covers the remaining $2,000.

### Factors Affecting Insurance Costs

- Age and health (for health and life insurance)
- Location (for home and auto insurance)
- Driving record (for auto insurance)
- Coverage level and deductible
