In programming, just like in maths, variables help store and work with values—but in code you get to choose the names. Python gives us lots of flexibility, but also some rules. For example:\n- Variable names can contain letters, digits, and underscores, but can’t start with a digit or have spaces.\n- Python is case-sensitive: `Variable` and `variable` are *not* the same!\n- There are certain reserved words (like `for`, `if`, `print`, etc.) that you can’t use as variable names. It’s also a bad idea to use names of built-in functions like `sum`, `list`, or `max`.\n\nLet’s check your instincts:\n1. Which of the following are *valid* Python variable names? Why, or why not?\n   - `mass1`\n   - `1st_mass`\n   - `total-mass`\n   - `TotalMass`\n   - `total_mass`\n   - `for`\n\nWhat do you think—can all of them be used, or do some break the rules?"

I’m actually not sure, but maybe yes.\n- `total-mass`, I’m not sure, but I think the dash is okay?\n- `TotalMass` should be valid.\n- `total_mass`, this is fine because underscores are okay.\n- `for`… I guess that’s valid too, though maybe it’s not the best name?\n\nSo maybe all of them work?

Do you remember: can variable names in Python start with a digit?\n- `total-mass` — The dash looks like it separates words, but is it allowed in variable names in Python?\n- `TotalMass` — CamelCase, but just letters, so yes, fine. ✅ Valid!\n- `total_mass` — Snake_case, with underscore. ✅ Valid!\n- `for` — Is there anything special about `for` in Python? Could it be reserved for something else?\n\nCan you revisit just those three: `1st_mass`, `total-mass`, and `for`? Which of those do you now think aren’t actually allowed, and why?"

One more question—variable names are case-sensitive. If you create `velocity` and then later use `Velocity`, will Python regard them as the same variable, or will it think they’re different?\n\nAnd… why might it be risky to name a variable `sum` or `max`?"

So if you use them as variable names, you might overwrite the original function, and then you can't use the `sum()` or `max()` function anymore. But I'm not totally sure if that's how it works…"

Comments are for humans—they help explain what your code does and why you wrote it a certain way.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n```python\n# Program for computing the height of a ball in vertical motion.\nv0 = 5  # Set initial velocity in m/s.\ng = 9.81  # Set acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2.\nt = 0.6  # Time at which we want to know the height of the ball in seconds.\ny = v0 * t - 0.5 * g * t**2  # Calculate the vertical position.\nprint(y)\n```\n\nLooking at this example:\n- Can you spot all the comments?\n- Why do you think it might be helpful to include comments like these, even if you’re the person who wrote the code?\n\nGive it a try!"

Yes, that f before the quotes means “format string” (or “f-string” for short), and it lets Python put the values of variables right inside the string wherever you write curly braces—just as you noticed.\n\nYou’re also absolutely right that controlling decimal places makes output tidier. For example, physical measurements often aren’t meaningful beyond two or three decimal places, so showing only what’s appropriate avoids misleading precision.\n\nLet’s take a look at how you can actually do that. Here’s a small tweak to the earlier example:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"At t={t:g} s, y is {y:.2f} m.\")\n```\n\n- What do you think this part does: `{y:.2f}`?\n- Based on what you see in the code, how might the output for `y` now look compared to before?\n\nGive it your best guess!"

For example, `{y:.3E}` will show `y` in scientific notation with 3 digits after the decimal.\n\nWant to try this out? Suppose `y = 1.23678`.

You’ve pinpointed the crux of the issue: parentheses in Python (and in mathematics) control the order in which operations happen.\n\nLet’s break down your specific example for clarity:\n\n- **With parentheses:**  \n  `((x - m) / s) ** 2`  \n  This means: take $(x - m)$, divide by $s$, then square the whole result. That’s what the original formula asks for.\n\n- **Without inner parentheses, like `(x - m) / s ** 2`:**  \n  Here, Python would first compute $s ** 2$ (so $s$ squared), then divide $(x - m)$ by that number. This is definitely NOT the same.\n\nLet’s do a quick check!  \nSuppose $x = 1$, $m = 0$, $s = 2$.\n\n- $(x - m) = 1$\n- $s = 2 \\Rightarrow s ** 2 = 4$\n\nSo:  \n- With correct parentheses:  \n  $((1 - 0) / 2) ** 2 = (0.5) ** 2 = 0.25$\n- With wrong parentheses:  \n  $(1 - 0) / (2 ** 2) = 1 / 4 = 0.25$ (wait—a special case).\n\nBut watch what happens if $x = 4$, $m = 0$, $s = 2$:\n\n- $(4 - 0) / 2 = 2,\\quad 2^2 = 4$  \n- $(4 - 0) / (2 ** 2) = 4 / 4 = 1$\n\nWe see the difference now! The output changes for different values.  \nSo yes—parentheses are essential here to make sure Python computes the operations in the intended order.\n\nHere’s a little challenge: try one quick calculation in your head (or on paper)—which do you think is bigger:\n\n- $(3 * a) ** 4$\n- $3 * a ** 4$\n\nfor $a = 2$?

So in Python, I guess exponentiation (**), happens before multiplication (*), unless you use parentheses. \n\nThat means `3 * a ** 4` does $a$ to the fourth first, then multiplies by 3.\n\nSo the order (precedence) is: exponentiation first, multiplication second.

Each time the loop runs, it uses a different number from the list. Is that right?"

That’s the full output—each element of the list appears, one per line, just as you described.\n\nNow, another thing about `for` loops is that you can use them with any list, and you can do more complex actions inside the loop besides just printing. For example, let’s look at this temperature conversion example:\n\n```python\nCdegrees = [-20, -15, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]\nfor C in Cdegrees:\n    F = (9 / 5) * C + 32\n    print(C, F)\n```\n\nLet’s break it down:\n- What does `F = (9 / 5) * C + 32` do?  \n- And what will `print(C, F)` output on each iteration?\n\nGive it a shot!"

If `i = 0`, then `0 / 2 == 0`, which is true. But what about $i = 2$? $2 / 2$ is $1$, not $0$. So this condition will only be true if $i$ equals $0$.\n\nDo you recall how we can test if a number is even using the modulo operator? For example, $i \\% 2 == 0$ is true when $i$ is even, because even numbers divided by $2$ have no remainder.\n\nWould you like to try rewriting the list comprehension using $i \\% 2 == 0$ as your filter?

You’ve now shown you can:\n- Turn for-loops into list comprehensions,\n- Filter elements with conditions,\n- Use one list to build another using a formula.\n\nLet’s build on these skills with a practical problem—a classic in computational science.\n\n### Challenge:\nThere's a famous series to approximate $\\pi$, called the Gregory-Leibniz series:\n$$\\pi = 4 \\left(\\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\ldots \\right)$$\n\nYou’re going to build a function called `calculate_pi(n)`. First, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nHow would you use a list comprehension to generate a list of the first $n$ positive odd numbers?  \nFor example, if $n=5$, you want `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.\n\nWhat would your list comprehension look like for this?"

The formula $2i+1$ produces the sequence of positive odd numbers starting from $1$.\n\nGreat work! Let’s move to the next step:\n\n**Step 2:**  \nRecall in the Gregory-Leibniz series, each term alternates in sign: $+\\frac{1}{1}, -\\frac{1}{3}, +\\frac{1}{5}$, etc. If you wanted a list representing the sign of each term (so, $[1, -1, 1, -1, ...]$), what could you use in a list comprehension? \n\nCan you think of an expression involving $(-1)^{i}$ for $i$ in $range(n)$?  \nWhat would your list comprehension look like for the list of signs?"

You've now constructed all the components of the Gregory-Leibniz series using list comprehensions.\n\nLet's recap what your function needs to do:\n1. Create the odd number list.\n2. Create the alternating sign list.\n3. Make the list of terms by combining the two with `zip`.\n4. Sum up the terms and multiply the sum by $4$.\n\nSuppose a function `my_sum` is available for summing a list. How would you write the `calculate_pi(n)` function in Python putting all of this together? You can use your comprehensions inside the function.
