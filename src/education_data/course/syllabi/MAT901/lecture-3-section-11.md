- **Conditional probability** helps us compute probabilities under new information.
- The **multiplication rule** for probabilities generalizes as $P(A \cap B) = P(A\mid B)P(B)$.
- **Independence** means the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of another.
- **Bayes' theorem** lets us "reverse" conditional probabilities, updating our belief in a cause given new evidence.

For next time, please review these exercises and come prepared to discuss real-world applications of conditional probability and independence!
