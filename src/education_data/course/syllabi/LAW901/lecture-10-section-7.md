As you move beyond this course, here are some recommendations to engage further with public law:

- **Follow current legal developments** in your jurisdiction by reading court decisions and legal analysis.
- **Engage with interdisciplinary research**—many public law issues now require knowledge of politics, technology, and economics.
- **Participate in moot courts, debates, or public policy forums** to practice legal reasoning in complex, real-life situations.
- **Write reflectively** about how public law impacts issues you care about, including those relating to digital rights, climate action, and social justice.
