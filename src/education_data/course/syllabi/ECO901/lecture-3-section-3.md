Inflation has broad effects on the economy. Its consequences can be both anticipated and unanticipated.

### Anticipated Inflation

- **Menu Costs**: Costs to businesses of frequently updating prices.
- **Shoe Leather Costs**: Increased cost of transactions as people keep less cash and make more frequent withdrawals to avoid holding depreciating money.
- **Bracket Creep**: Taxpayers pushed into higher tax brackets due to nominal income rises, even if real income is unchanged.

### Unanticipated Inflation

- **Redistribution of Wealth**: Transfers wealth between debtors and creditors. If inflation is higher than expected, debtors benefit as they repay loans with "cheaper" dollars.
- **Uncertainty and Planning**: Businesses and consumers face more risk and may reduce investment and spending.
- **Distortion of Price Signals**: Makes it difficult to distinguish real price changes from inflation.

**Example**:  
If you borrow $1000 at 5% interest expecting low inflation, but inflation jumps to 10%, you return the $1000 plus $50 in interest, but those dollars are worth much less.

### Hyperinflation and Deflation

#### Hyperinflation

- Extremely rapid and out-of-control price increases.
- Mostly caused by excessive growth of money supply (often by governments printing money to cover deficits).
- Leads to collapse in use of money as a store of value, and often to "barter" economies.

**Historical Example**:  
Zimbabwe (2000s): Prices doubling daily, 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar notes printed.

#### Deflation

- General fall in prices.
- Can be dangerous: consumers may delay purchases, leading to lower demand, higher unemployment, and further price falls (deflationary spiral).
- Examples: The Great Depression in 1930s USA.
