When testing hypotheses, two kinds of mistakes can be made:

### Type I Error

- **Definition:** Rejecting $H_0$ when it is actually true.
- **Probability:** Denoted by $\alpha$ (the significance level).
- **Consequence:** Claiming an effect exists when it does not (a "false positive").

### Type II Error

- **Definition:** Failing to reject $H_0$ when $H_A$ is true.
- **Probability:** Denoted by $\beta$.
- **Consequence:** Failing to detect a real effect (a "false negative").

**Summary Table:**

|                | $H_0$ True | $H_0$ False (i.e., $H_A$ True) |
|----------------|:----------:|:------------------------------:|
| Reject $H_0$   | Type I     | Correct Decision               |
| Fail to Reject $H_0$ | Correct Decision | Type II                |

**Power of the Test:** The probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_A$ is true ($1 - \beta$).
