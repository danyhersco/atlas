Being a responsible borrower means understanding your needs, knowing your ability to repay, and choosing the right kind of credit.

**Key Principles:**
- Only borrow what you can afford to repay.
- Compare offers (interest rates, fees, terms).
- Read all terms and conditions.
- Make payments on time.
- Pay more than the minimum when possible.

**Example:**  
Suppose your monthly budget can only afford $200 for loan payments. If you take a loan with payments of $300/month, you'll likely struggle to keep up, leading to late payments and extra fees.
