The *complement* of an event $A$ is the event "A does not occur," written as $A'$.

The sum of the probabilities of an event and its complement is 1:

$$
P(A) + P(A') = 1 \
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
$$

### Example:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 4 on a die:

- $A = \{5, 6\}$
- $P(A) = 2/6 = 1/3$
- $P(A') = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$ (probability of rolling 4 or less)
