GDP figures can be misleading if they do not account for changes in price levels over time. To tackle this, we distinguish between **nominal** and **real** GDP.

### Nominal GDP

- Measured in current prices, i.e., unadjusted for inflation.
- Reflects changes in both quantity and prices.

### Real GDP

- Adjusted for inflation.
- Uses prices from a base year (constant prices).
- Reflects changes in actual production/quantities.

**Formula for Real GDP:**

If $NGDP$ = nominal GDP, $P$ = price index (CPI or GDP deflator), $P_b$ = price index in base year:

$$
\text{Real GDP} = \frac{NGDP}{P} \times 100
$$

**Example:**

Suppose the nominal GDP in 2023 is $1,100$, and the GDP deflator is $110$ (base year = 100):

$$
\text{Real GDP} = \frac{1,100}{110} \times 100 = 1,000
$$

This means that if there had been no inflation, the GDP value would be $1,000$.

### GDP Deflator

The GDP Deflator measures the overall change in prices (price level) used to convert nominal GDP to real GDP:

$$
\text{GDP Deflator} = \frac{Nominal\ GDP}{Real\ GDP} \times 100
$$
