**Problem**:  
Suppose in a small economy, a representative consumer basket contains the following:

- 10 loaves of bread (price per loaf: $2 in Year 1, $2.20 in Year 2)
- 5 pounds of chicken (price per pound: $3 in Year 1, $3.60 in Year 2)
- 4 gallons of milk (price per gallon: $1.50 in Year 1, $1.65 in Year 2)

1. Calculate the cost of the basket in Year 1 and Year 2.
2. Construct the CPI for Year 2 (use Year 1 as base year).
3. Compute the inflation rate between Year 1 and Year 2.
