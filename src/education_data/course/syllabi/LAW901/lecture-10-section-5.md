Let's summarize key takeaways and reflect on the larger themes:

### Overarching Questions in Public Law

- **How are power and rights balanced in society?**
- **What legal mechanisms protect democracy and individual freedoms?**
- **How does public law adapt to evolving social and technological realities?**

### Integration of Themes

**From Foundations to the Future:**
- We began with the basics (what is public law and how is it different from private law).
- We investigated courts, constitutions, and the separation of powers.
- We looked at rights protection in various systems, and concrete case studies.
- Now, we see public law as a living discipline — one that must continually respond to new societal challenges.
