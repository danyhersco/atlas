Interest is the cost of borrowing money, or, conversely, the reward for lending or saving money. The two principal types of interest calculations are simple interest and compound interest.

### Simple Interest

Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount for each period.

The formula for simple interest is:

$$
\text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t
$$

Where:
- $P$ = Principal (initial amount)
- $r$ = Interest rate per period (as a decimal)
- $t$ = Number of periods (years)

#### Example

Suppose you deposit $1,000 in a savings account that earns simple interest at a rate of 5% per year for 3 years.

- $P = 1,000$
- $r = 0.05$
- $t = 3$

$$
\text{Simple Interest} = 1,000 \times 0.05 \times 3 = \$150
$$

At the end of 3 years, you would have earned $150 in interest, for a total of $1,150.

### Compound Interest

Compound interest is calculated on the principal, *plus* any interest that has already been earned. In other words, each period, interest is earned on a larger amount than the previous period.

The formula for compound interest (without additional contributions) is:

$$
A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
$$

Where:
- $A$ = Final amount
- $P$ = Principal
- $r$ = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
- $n$ = Number of compounding periods per year
- $t$ = Number of years

#### Example

Suppose you invest $1,000 in an account earning 5% annual interest, compounded *annually* ($n = 1$) for 3 years.

- $P = 1,000$
- $r = 0.05$
- $n = 1$
- $t = 3$

$$
A = 1,000 \times (1 + \frac{0.05}{1})^{1 \times 3} = 1,000 \times (1.05)^3 \approx 1,157.63
$$

So with compound interest, you earn about $157.63$ in interest over three years, more than with simple interest.

##### Compounding More Frequently

If instead, the interest is compounded *monthly* ($n = 12$):

$$
A = 1,000 \times \left(1 + \frac{0.05}{12}\right)^{12 \times 3}
$$

Let's calculate step by step:

- $0.05/12 = 0.0041667$
- $12 \times 3 = 36$
- $1 + 0.0041667 = 1.0041667$
- $1.0041667^{36} \approx 1.1616$

Final amount:

$$
A = 1,000 \times 1.1616 = 1,161.60
$$

With monthly compounding, interest earned is about $161.60$.
