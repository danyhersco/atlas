**Discussion Prompt:**

Consider a situation where a government, in response to protests, suspends the right to assemble and blocks social media. The government claims the measures are to prevent violence.

Reflect on:

- What rights are at stake?
- How should a court assess whether such restrictions are justified?
- Can you think of less restrictive ways to achieve the government's stated goal?

Write a short essay (200-300 words) presenting your analysis.
