One primary objective of monetary policy is to influence **interest rates**, most importantly the **short-term federal funds rate** (the rate at which commercial banks lend to each other overnight).

### How Changing Money Supply Affects Interest Rates

- **Increase in money supply** ⇒ More funds available to lend ⇒ **Decrease in interest rates**
- **Decrease in money supply** ⇒ Less funds available to lend ⇒ **Increase in interest rates**

### Transmission Mechanism

Interest rates influence broader economic activity through several channels:

- **Consumption**: Lower rates make borrowing cheaper (e.g., for car loans, mortgages), stimulating spending.
- **Investment**: Firms borrow more to expand when interest rates are low.
- **Exchange Rate**: Lower rates can weaken the currency, making exports more competitive.
