Even the best-designed budget will be ineffective unless you keep track of your *actual* spending and earning.

### Methods of Tracking

1. **Pen and Paper**: Use a notebook to record every income and expense as it occurs.
2. **Spreadsheets**: Tools like Google Sheets or Excel let you create dynamic budget trackers.
3. **Budgeting Apps**: Many apps automatically connect to your bank accounts and categorize expenses.

**Spreadsheet Example**:

```python
# Simple Python-style pseudocode for monthly expense tracking

income = 1850
expenses = {
    'Rent': 650,
    'Groceries': 200,
    'Utilities': 100,
    'Transportation': 70,
    'Phone': 30,
    'Entertainment': 50,
    'Savings': 400
}

total_expenses = sum(expenses.values())
net_income = income - total_expenses

print("Net income for the month:", net_income)
```

### Regular Review

Set a frequency to review your budget—typically weekly or monthly. Compare actual spending to what was budgeted.
- Are you going over in some categories?
- Did you underestimate/overestimate any costs?
- Are you meeting your savings goal?
