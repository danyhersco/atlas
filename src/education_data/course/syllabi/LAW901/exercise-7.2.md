**Case Analysis Exercise:**

Read the following scenario:

*A national parliament passes a law allowing the government to restrict internet access and ban public gatherings for reasons of “national security,” but does not specify criteria or provide for appeals.*

- Identify which fundamental rights may be affected.
- Discuss whether these limitations would likely pass the proportionality test.
- Suggest at least one way the law could be revised to better safeguard fundamental rights.
