- Type of data (categorical vs quantitative) determines analysis method.
- **Central tendency:** mean, median, mode.
- **Dispersion:** range, variance, standard deviation, IQR.
- **Visualization:** histograms (distribution), boxplots (spread/outliers).
- Choosing the right summary and visualization is critical for meaningful data analysis.
