A test for a disease is positive for 97% of those who have it and 2% of healthy people. The disease affects 0.5% of the population.

1. If a randomly selected person tests positive, what is the probability they actually have the disease? (Use Bayes' theorem.)
2. Suppose the test comes back positive for two independent tests. What is the probability that the person has the disease now? (Assume test outcomes are independent for those with/without the disease.)
