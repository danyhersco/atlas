The allocation and safeguarding of powers are at the heart of federalism. This is typically done through constitutional provisions that enumerate and sometimes imply respective competences.

### Methods for Allocation

1. **Enumerated Powers:** The national government’s powers are specifically listed.
2. **Residual Powers:** All powers not explicitly granted to the central government remain with constituent states/provinces.
3. **Concurrent Powers:** Some powers are shared between national and subnational governments.
4. **Supremacy Clauses:** Constitutions often contain clauses that give precedence to national law when conflicts arise.

#### Example: United States Constitution

The US Constitution allocates powers as follows:

- **Article I, Section 8:** Lists the enumerated powers of Congress (e.g., to coin money, regulate interstate commerce).
- **Tenth Amendment:** "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

#### Example: Canadian Constitution

- **Section 91 (Federal Powers):** Defense, trade, currency, banking.
- **Section 92 (Provincial Powers):** Education, property and civil rights, local matters.
- **Pith and Substance Doctrine:** Helps determine the ‘real nature’ of legislation when powers overlap.
