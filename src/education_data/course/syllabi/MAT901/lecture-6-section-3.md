Central tendency statistics summarize the "middle" or "center" of a data set.

### Mean

The **mean** is the average value:
$$
\text{Mean (} \bar{x} \text{)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
$$
Where $x_i$ are the data points and $n$ is the number of points.

**Example:**
Suppose the daily sales for a week are [20, 23, 21, 25, 22, 24, 22].  
Mean = (20 + 23 + 21 + 25 + 22 + 24 + 22) / 7 = 22.43

### Median

The **median** is the middle value when the data is ordered.

- If $n$ is odd, median is the middle value.
- If $n$ is even, median is the average of the two middle values.

**Example:**
For [20, 21, 22, 22, 23, 24, 25] (ordered), median = 22.

### Mode

The **mode** is the most frequently occurring value.

**Example:**  
For [20, 23, 21, 25, 22, 24, 22], the mode is 22 (which appears twice).

#### When to Use Which?
- **Mean:** Very sensitive to outliers.
- **Median:** Robust to extreme values.
- **Mode:** Useful for categorical data or detecting common values.
