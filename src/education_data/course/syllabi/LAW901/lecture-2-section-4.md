The development of public law is closely tied to the evolution of political systems and democratic institutions.

### From Monarchy to Democracy

- *Feudalism*: Decentralized power, limited central authority, early versions of public law enforced by local lords.
- *Early Parliaments*: Magna Carta limited royal power; English Parliament gained legislative authority.
- *Constitutional Government*: Glorious Revolution (1688-89) in England led to constitutional monarchy and supremacy of Parliament.

### Modern Constitutions

Constitutions formalize the rules of public governance. Notable historical moments include:
- **The United States Constitution (1787):** Created an explicit division of powers (separation of powers, checks and balances).
- **Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (France, 1789):** Articulated equality before the law and other fundamental rights.

### Expansion of Rights

- *19th-20th centuries*: Extension of suffrage, abolition of slavery, emergence of social rights (education, welfare).
- *Post-WWII*: Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), wave of new constitutions in decolonized states.
