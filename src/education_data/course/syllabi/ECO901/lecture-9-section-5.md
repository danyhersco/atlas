Let’s walk through the steps of **expansionary** and **contractionary** monetary policy.

### Expansionary Monetary Policy

Used to combat recession and high unemployment.

- Central bank **lowers interest rates** and/or **increases money supply**
- Encourages borrowing, spending, and investment
- Increases aggregate demand
- Leads to higher output, and (potentially) higher employment
- Risk: inflation could accelerate if output exceeds productive capacity

### Contractionary Monetary Policy

Used to fight inflation.

- Central bank **raises interest rates** and/or **reduces money supply**
- Discourages borrowing and spending
- Lowers aggregate demand
- Brings inflation under control but could slow growth and increase unemployment

### The AD-AS Model and Monetary Policy

Recall from Lecture 5: in the **Aggregate Demand - Aggregate Supply (AD-AS) model**:

- **Expansionary policy** shifts AD to the right → higher output and prices
- **Contractionary policy** shifts AD to the left → lower output and prices

Graphically:

$$
\text{AD}_0 \rightarrow \text{AD}_1 \quad (\text{with expansionary monetary policy})
