- **Population**: The entire set of individuals or items we want to study.
- **Sample**: A subset of the population, selected for analysis.

### Reasons for Sampling
- **Cost and Convenience**: Collecting data from an entire population is often too expensive and time-consuming.
- **Destructive Testing**: Sometimes, testing units destroys them (e.g., crash-testing cars).
- **Timeliness**: Decisions often need to be made quickly; sampling provides faster results.
- **Data Accessibility**: Some populations are unobservable in their entirety (e.g., future customers).

When *properly* conducted, sampling allows us to estimate population parameters (e.g., the mean) with measurable reliability.
