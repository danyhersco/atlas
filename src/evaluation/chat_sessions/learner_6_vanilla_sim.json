Write the Formula in Math:**\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times r^2 \\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle.\n\n**2. Identify Each Part:**\n- \\( \\pi \\) (pi): a constant, approximately 3.14159.\n- \\( r \\): the radius (will be a number we choose).\n- \\( r^2 \\): means “r squared”, or \\( r \\times r \\).\n\n**3. Map the Formula to Python:**\n- Use `math.pi` for \\( \\pi \\) in Python (using the `math` module).\n- Use `**2` for squaring in Python.\n\n**4. Let's Write the Code:**\n\nFirst, we need to import the math module. Let’s try writing the code step-by-step:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nradius = 5  # You can change this to any number\narea = math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n\nprint(\"The area of the circle is:\", area)\n```\n\n**Let’s Review:**\n- `import math` gives us access to `math.pi`.\n- `radius ** 2` means “radius squared”.\n- `math.pi * (radius ** 2)` is our formula.\n\nDo you see how each math part turns into Python?

It makes your intention obvious: you want the square root.\n- `** 0.5` is more “math shorthand” and works for any root (e.g., cube root `** (1/3)`), but it might not be as clear to someone reading your code.\n\n**In summary:**  \n- **Your code is perfect!**  \n- If you ever use `math.sqrt()`, don’t forget `import math` at the top.\n- If you use `** 0.5`, you don’t need to import anything extra.\n\n**Want an extra challenge?**  \nTry writing code for the *cube root* of a number.

For example, `27 ** (1/3)` might give you `3.0`, or it might look like `2.9999999999999996`. This is normal in programming and not a mistake—just how math works on computers.\n\n**To summarize:**\n- You do **not** need the math module for cube roots; your code is correct!\n- For **square roots**, you can use either `math.sqrt(x)` or `x ** 0.5`.\n- For **cube roots and higher**, always use `x ** (1/n)`.\n\nIf you want even more practice, you could try writing code for the n-th root of a number (where the user chooses `n`).

This is a common style in Python called \"snake_case\".\n\nSo, you should write:\n\n```python\nfavourite_number = 8\n```\n\nThis way, `favourite_number` is a single word in Python's eyes, but it's still easy for people to read.\n\nHere are a few more rules about variable names in Python:\n\n1. **No spaces**—use underscores instead.\n2. **Can use letters, numbers, and underscores**, but the name **cannot start with a number.**\n3. **Don’t use Python’s keywords** (like `if`, `for`, `class`) as variable names.\n\nWant to try making another variable?

This makes the variable clear and readable, and Python will understand it perfectly.\n\n**Quick tip to remember:**  \nIf you have more than one word in a variable name, always link them with underscores. For example:  \n- `total_score`\n- `user_age`\n- `average_height`\n\nIf you accidentally include a space (like `birth year`), Python will show an error:  \n```\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\n\nKeep practicing!

(`favorite_book = \"Dune\"`)\n\nIf you want to check the value stored in your variable, you can print it:\n```python\nprint(favorite_color)\n```\nThis will show you:  \n```\npurple\n```\n\nWould you like to try creating another variable, maybe for your city or a hobby, just for more practice?

Let’s break it down:\n\n### **How to Combine Text and Variables in `print()`**\n\nYou can combine text and variables in a few ways, but the two most common for beginners are:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Using Commas in `print()`**\n\nYou can separate text and variables with commas inside the `print()` function:\n```python\nfavorite_color = \"blue\"\nprint(\"My favorite color is\", favorite_color)\n```\n**What happens here?**\n- Text in quotes (`\"My favorite color is\"`) will print as-is.\n- The variable `favorite_color` (no quotes!) prints its value (`blue`) right after the text.\n\n**Output:**  \n```\nMy favorite color is blue\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Using f-strings (formatted strings)**\n\n**f-strings** (available in Python 3.6 and later) allow you to create a sentence with variables directly inside it, using curly braces `{}`:\n\n```python\nfavorite_color = \"blue\"\nprint(f\"My favorite color is {favorite_color}\")\n```\nNotice:\n- The `f` before the opening quotation mark tells Python you're making a formatted string.\n- The variable goes inside `{}` without quotes.\n\n**Output:**  \n```\nMy favorite color is blue\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Key tips:**\n- **Text** always goes in quotes.\n- **Variables** go inside curly braces `{}` (if you use f-strings), or after a comma (if you use the first method), with no quotes.\n\n---\n\n**Want to try it yourself?**  \nWrite a print statement that says:\n```\nI live in Mumbai and I am 165 cm tall.\n```\n…but use your variables (`city_name` and `my_height`) instead of writing the info as text!\n\nTry both ways: one with commas, and one with an f-string.

Clear comments like this help you and others remember the purpose of the code, especially when projects get complicated.\n\nLet’s take it a step further! Sometimes, your code might need a longer explanation. In these cases, you can use multi-line comments—although Python doesn’t have a special multi-line comment syntax like some languages. Instead, you can use the `#` symbol at the start of each line:\n\n```python\n# This program prints a greeting.\n# It also tells the user their age.\nprint(\"Hello!\")\nprint(\"You are\", my_age, \"years old.\")\n```\n\nTry writing a short block of code with a multi-line comment explaining what the code does.

Try explaining *why* you’re doing that, or any assumptions behind your approach.\n\n2. **Keep comments up to date:** Always update comments if you change the code—old or misleading comments can cause confusion.\n\nLet’s try this: imagine you write a code snippet that finds the average of three test scores. Write the code, and add comments that explain (a) the general purpose of the code, and (b) why you are dividing by three. Give it a try!"

These are often used for documentation. While they're not technically comments, they're a great way to describe the overall purpose of a program or function.\n\nFor example:\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThis script calculates the average of three test scores.\nIt then prints out the average score.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nTry adding a docstring at the very top of your previous code, summarizing what the program does.

This means making the information you print look exactly how you want—like setting the number of decimal places or arranging text neatly.\n\nWe use formatted output to display variables nicely. Python offers a few ways to do this:\n- f-strings\n- the `format()` method\n- the percent `%` operator\n\nLet’s start with f-strings, which were introduced in Python 3.6 and are now the most popular. Here’s a simple example:\n\n```python\nname = \"Alex\"\nage = 20\nprint(f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n```\n\nThis will print:\n```\nMy name is Alex and I am 20 years old.\n```\n\nTry writing a line using f-strings that prints your name and favorite number. Remember to use variables!"

            "content": "Great attempt! You’re really close. The idea is perfect, but you’re missing one key part for f-strings: you need to put an `f` before the opening quote in your print statement.\n\nWithout the `f`, Python won’t replace `{my_name}` and `{fav_number}` with the values of your variables—it just prints it exactly as written.\n\nSo, here’s the corrected code:\n\n```python\nmy_name = \"Priya\"\nfav_number = 7\nprint(f\"My name is {my_name} and my favorite number is {fav_number}.\")\n```\n\nIf you run this, you’ll get:\n```\nMy name is Priya and my favorite number is 7.\n```\n\nNow, f-strings can do even more! For instance, you can format numbers to show a certain number of decimal places. Try this:\n\n```python\npi = 3.14159265359\nprint(f\"Pi rounded to 2 decimals: {pi:.2f}\")\n```\n\nCan you guess what this will print? And do you want to try printing your favorite number rounded to 3 decimal places?"

Since your favorite number is `7`, it will print:\n\n```\nMy favorite number rounded to 3 decimals: 7.000\n```\n\nEven though `7` is an integer, formatting it as `.3f` displays three decimal places.\n\nLet’s quickly see how the other formatting methods work. Here’s the same idea using the `format()` method:\n\n```python\nname = \"Priya\"\nfav_number = 7\nprint(\"My name is {} and my favorite number is {}.\".format(name, fav_number))\n\npi = 3.14159265359\nprint(\"Pi rounded to 2 decimals: {:.2f}\".format(pi))\n```\n\nAnd with the percent (`%`) operator (older style):\n\n```python\nname = \"Priya\"\nfav_number = 7\nprint(\"My name is %s and my favorite number is %d.\" % (name, fav_number))\n\npi = 3.14159265359\nprint(\"Pi rounded to 2 decimals: %.2f\" % pi)\n```\n\nDo you notice how the placeholders and the way values are inserted are different in each method?\n\nWant to try converting one of your earlier print statements to use the `format()` method or `%` operator? Pick one and give it a shot!"

When you run this, you’ll see:\n```\nMy name is Priya and my favorite number is 7.\n```\n\nYou can also format numbers to a certain precision, just like with f-strings:\n```python\nprint(\"Pi rounded to 2 decimals: {:.2f}\".format(pi))\n```\nThis prints \"Pi rounded to 2 decimals: 3.14\".\n\nWant to try using the percent operator (`%`) for the same message?

The main focus will be on how Python decides what part of a mathematical expression to solve first — this is called operator precedence.

Consider this arithmetic expression:\n\n```python\nresult = 3 + 4 * 2\n```\n\nWhat do you think the value of `result` would be? Do you think Python adds first or multiplies first?

            "content": "That's a great guess, and it makes sense if you always go left to right. However, Python (and most programming languages) follows specific rules for **operator precedence**.\n\n**Multiplication (`*`)** has a higher precedence than addition (`+`). This means Python will multiply before it adds.\n\nHere’s how Python evaluates `3 + 4 * 2`:\n1. Calculate the multiplication first: `4 * 2 = 8`\n2. Then add the result to 3: `3 + 8 = 11`\n\nSo the value of `result` is **11**, not 14!\n\nIf you actually wanted Python to add first, you’d need to help it out by using parentheses. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = (3 + 4) * 2\n```\n\nHere, Python will:\n1. Add `3 + 4 = 7` first (because parentheses have the highest precedence),\n2. Then multiply by 2: `7 * 2 = 14`.\n\nSee the difference? Parentheses are a powerful tool for controlling the order of evaluation.\n\nWould you like to try rewriting an expression using parentheses to change the order of operations?"

Let’s talk about how **division** fits into operator precedence in Python.\n\nDivision (`/`) has the same precedence as multiplication (`*`), and both are evaluated before addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`). That means Python will do multiplication and division before adding or subtracting.\n\nLet’s look at an example:\n\n```python\nresult = 8 + 12 / 4\n```\n\nHere’s how Python evaluates it:\n1. First, the division: `12 / 4 = 3.0` (note: division in Python gives a float result, even if the numbers divide evenly)\n2. Then, the addition: `8 + 3.0 = 11.0`\n\nSo, `result` will be **11.0**.\n\nNow, if you want the addition to happen first, you use parentheses:\n\n```python\nresult = (8 + 12) / 4\n```\n1. First, add: `8 + 12 = 20`\n2. Then, divide: `20 / 4 = 5.0`\n\nIn this case, `result` is **5.0**.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Multiplication (`*`) and division (`/`) happen before addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`).\n- Parentheses always change the order so their contents are computed first.\n\nWould you like to predict the result of an expression like `20 - 9 / 3`?

Division: `11 / 3 = 3.666...` (In Python, the result will be `3.6666666666666665`)\n    So, the result is approximately **3.67**.\n\nYou’re correctly applying operator precedence and using parentheses to control the calculation order.

Do you know what a function argument is in Python? For example:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n```\n\nWhen you call `greet(\"Alice\")`, `\"Alice\"` is an argument passed to the function. With that in mind, can you tell me what happens if you call `greet()` with no arguments?"

        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Great guess! Actually, if you call `greet()` with no arguments like this:\n\n```python\ngreet()\n```\n\nPython will give you an **error**. That's because the function `greet(name)` requires one argument, and if you don't provide it, Python won't know what to use for `name`.\n\nYou'll see something like:\n\n```\nTypeError: greet() missing 1 required positional argument: 'name'\n```\n\nBut what if we want the function to work even if you don’t provide a name? That’s where **default values** come in! For example:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name=\"friend\"):\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n```\n\nNow, if you call `greet()`, what do you think will be printed? And what will it print if you call `greet(\"Alice\")`?"

            "role": "user",

        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Exactly right! You've got it:\n\n- `greet()` will print:  \n  **Hello, friend!**\n\n- `greet(\"Alice\")` will print:  \n  **Hello, Alice!**\n\nThe value you provide as an argument (\"Alice\") overrides the default value (\"friend\"). If you don’t provide an argument, Python uses the default.\n\nNow, let's talk about **keyword arguments**. These let you make your code clearer and more flexible. For example, with this version:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name=\"friend\", greeting=\"Hello\"):\n    print(greeting + \", \" + name + \"!\")\n```\n\nYou can call the function using keywords, like this:\n\n```python\ngreet(name=\"Bob\", greeting=\"Good morning\")\n```\n\nWhat will that print? And what if you only write `greet(greeting=\"Hi\")`?"
        },

            "content": "Um, for `greet(name=\"Bob\", greeting=\"Good morning\")`, I think it will print \"Good morning, Bob!\".\n\nIf you do `greet(greeting=\"Hi\")`, then since you didn’t put a name, it will use the default name, so I think it prints \"Hi, friend!\"."

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Perfect! That's absolutely correct.\n\n- `greet(name=\"Bob\", greeting=\"Good morning\")` prints:  \n  **Good morning, Bob!**\n- `greet(greeting=\"Hi\")` prints:  \n  **Hi, friend!**\n\nUsing keyword arguments allows you to specify only the values you want to change, and the rest will use their defaults.\n\nLet’s try one more thing: with keyword arguments, you don’t have to follow the original parameter order. For example, these two calls are the same:\n\n```python\ngreet(greeting=\"Welcome\", name=\"Sandy\")\ngreet(name=\"Sandy\", greeting=\"Welcome\")\n```\n\nBoth will print **Welcome, Sandy!**\n\nNow, let’s try making your own function! Can you write a function called `order_pizza` that takes three arguments: `size` (default `\"medium\"`), `topping` (default `\"cheese\"`), and `crust` (default `\"regular\"`)? The function should print something like:  \n_You ordered a medium pizza with cheese on regular crust._\n\nTry writing this function—use default values for all the parameters."

With no arguments\n2. With one keyword argument (like `topping=\"pepperoni\"`)\n3.

You can use `while number <= 3:` instead.\n\nTry updating your loop to this:\n\n```python\nnumber = 1\nwhile number <= 3:\n    print(number)\n    number = number + 1\n```\n\nThis will print:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nWould you like to try modifying your code to include the number 3?

By using `while number <= 3:`, your loop now includes the number 3 too.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nHere's how it works step by step:\n- `number = 1` (condition is true, prints 1, increments to 2)\n- `number = 2` (condition is true, prints 2, increments to 3)\n- `number = 3` (condition is true, prints 3, increments to 4)\n- `number = 4` (condition is false, loop ends)\n\nGreat job! Your indentation is also perfect—every line inside the loop is indented. In Python, proper indentation is essential to show which statements are inside the loop.\n\nWould you like to try another while loop, perhaps making it count down from 3 to 1? Let me show you how you might do that, and then you can try writing it yourself. Here’s an example structure:\n\n```python\nnumber = 3\nwhile number >= 1:\n    print(number)\n    number = number - 1\n```\n\nGive it a try! See if you can modify your code to count down instead."

This will make `number` increase: 3 → 4 → 5… So, the condition `number >= 1` will always be true, and the loop won't stop. In fact, this creates an **infinite loop**.\n\nTo **count down** from 3 to 1, you want to **subtract 1** each time, like this:\n\n```python\nnumber = 3\nwhile number >= 1:\n    print(number)\n    number = number - 1\n```\n\nHere:\n- `number = 3`\n- Prints 3, then subtracts 1 (`number = 2`)\n- Prints 2, then subtracts 1 (`number = 1`)\n- Prints 1, then subtracts 1 (`number = 0`)\n- Now, `number >= 1` is `False`, so the loop ends.\n\nThis will print:\n```\n3\n2\n1\n```\n\nTry changing `number = number + 1` to `number = number - 1` in your code!

The most important thing is to keep experimenting and practicing, just as you’re doing.\n\nHere’s a helpful tip when writing a while loop on your own:\n1. **Decide on your condition:** What do you want the loop to keep checking?\n2. **Initialize your variable:** Make sure your variable has a starting value.\n3. **Indent your actions:** Every line inside the loop must be indented.\n4. **Update your variable:** Make sure your variable changes each time, so your condition will eventually be false and the loop can end.\n\nFor example, if you want to print numbers from 5 down to 1:\n\n```python\nnumber = 5\nwhile number >= 1:\n    print(number)\n    number = number - 1\n```\n\nIf you get stuck, try writing it step by step, and read the output carefully. Often, seeing what your code does helps you figure out what needs to change.\n\nPractice makes perfect! When you’re ready or need a hint, I’m here for you. You got this!"

When `number` becomes 1, `number > 1` is no longer true, so the loop stops before printing 1.\n\nIf you want to include 1 as well, you should use `>= 1` instead:\n\n```python\nnumber = 5\nwhile number >= 1:\n    print(number)\n    number = number - 1\n```\n\nNow, it will print:\n```\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n```\n\nYou did everything else perfectly—the variable starts at 5, you correctly indent the code, and you update the variable each loop. Just remember: the condition determines the last value printed!\n\nTry changing your loop to use `number >= 1` and see how the output changes.

Let me clarify how the for loop works with a list.\n\nWhen you write:\n\n```python\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n```\n\nhere’s what happens step-by-step:\n\n1. The loop starts with the first item in the list (`\"apple\"`). The variable `fruit` now has the value `\"apple\"`, and the loop runs the code inside (in this case, it prints `\"apple\"`).\n2. Next, the loop moves to the second item. Now, `fruit` becomes `\"banana\"`, and it prints `\"banana\"`.\n3. Then, it moves to the third item. `fruit` is now `\"cherry\"`, and it prints `\"cherry\"`.\n4. When there are no more items left in the list, the loop stops.\n\nSo, to answer your question: **the variable (`fruit`) takes on the value of each item in the list, one by one, in order**. It does not always mean the first item—**it changes with every loop!**\n\nWould you like to see what happens if you use a different variable name, or maybe how to use the position (index) of each item in the list?"

        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Exactly right! If you write\n\n```python\nfor x in fruits:\n    print(x)\n```\n\nthen `x` will take on the values \"apple\", then \"banana\", then \"cherry\"—just like `fruit` did before. The variable name you use (`fruit`, `x`, or anything else) is just a label for each item as you go through the list.\n\nNow, let's talk about **indices** (positions of items in the list).\n\nIn Python, each item in a list has a position called an index, starting at 0. So in your `fruits` list:\n- `\"apple\"` is at index 0,\n- `\"banana\"` is at index 1,\n- `\"cherry\"` is at index 2.\n\nIf you want to loop through the list and get both the index and the item, you can use the `enumerate` function, like this:\n\n```python\nfor index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n    print(\"Index:\", index, \"Fruit:\", fruit)\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n```\nIndex: 0 Fruit: apple\nIndex: 1 Fruit: banana\nIndex: 2 Fruit: cherry\n```\n\n- `index` keeps track of the number (position) for each item.\n- `fruit` gives you the actual item at that position.\n\nThis is really helpful if you need to know where you are in the list as you loop!\n\nWould you like to see another example, or try using indices for a different list?"

            "content": "Great question! You have two good options for showing a message if the list is empty:\n\n### **Option 1: Check Before the Loop**\nYou can check if the list is empty using an `if` statement before starting the loop:\n\n```python\nnumbers = []\n\nif not numbers:  # if the list is empty\n    print(\"No items found!\")\nelse:\n    for number in numbers:\n        print(number)\n```\n\n- If the list has items, the for loop prints them.\n- If it’s empty, only the “No items found!” message appears.\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Use the `else` Block with the Loop**\nIn Python, for loops can have an `else` block—a neat trick! The `else` part runs *only if* the loop was not broken with a `break` statement. If the loop does not run at all (because the list was empty), the `else` will run:\n\n```python\nnumbers = []\n\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\nelse:\n    print(\"No items found!\")\n```\n\n**But:**  \n- If the list is empty, only the “No items found!” will print.\n- If the list has items, the `else` block *still* runs—but only after the loop finishes. So, for checking if a list was truly empty, the first option (with an explicit `if not numbers`) is usually clearer.\n\n---\n\n#### **Best practice:**\nMost programmers use the first method:\n```python\nif not numbers:\n    print(\"No items found!\")\nelse:\n    for number in numbers:\n        print(number)\n```\nbecause it’s very clear and easy to read.\n\nWould you like to try this out, or do you want to see more tricks you can use with for loops and lists?"

Or does it always print it, even if there are items? This is really confusing for me."

        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "That’s a smart observation—this part of Python can definitely feel confusing!\n\nLet’s clarify exactly how the `else` block with a `for` loop works:\n\n### 1. What actually happens\n- **The `else` block after a `for` loop will always run—**\n  - **Unless** you use a `break` statement inside the loop to exit early.\n- If the list is **empty**, the `for` loop doesn’t run at all, so Python immediately runs the `else`.\n- If the list has **items**, Python first goes through the loop. When the loop finishes normally (not with `break`), then the `else` runs.\n\n### 2. Example\n\n#### With items:\n```python\nnumbers = [5, 10]\n\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\nelse:\n    print(\"No items found!\")\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n5\n10\nNo items found!\n```\nSee what happened? The `else` runs after the loop even though the list wasn’t empty.\n\n#### With empty list:\n```python\nnumbers = []\n\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\nelse:\n    print(\"No items found!\")\n```\n**Output:**\n```\nNo items found!\n```\nHere, only the `else` runs because the list was empty.\n\n### 3. When to use each method\n\n- If you want to show “No items found!” *only* when the list is empty, it’s **best** to check with `if not numbers:` before your loop.\n- The `for ... else` combo is mainly useful in special situations, like searching for something in a list and using `break` to exit early.\n\n### 4. Best practice\n\n**For showing a message only for empty lists, do this:**\n```python\nif not numbers:\n    print(\"No items found!\")\nelse:\n    for number in numbers:\n        print(number)\n```\nThis will only print “No items found!” when your list is actually empty.\n\nWould you like to practice using this, or maybe see how `for ... else` can be useful for searching?"

I definitely see why it’s better to use `if not numbers:` for this case…\n\nMaybe I need to try this before it makes sense, or could you show me an example where the `for...else` is actually useful?

For checking if a list is empty and showing a message, `if not numbers:` is almost always clearer and better.\n\nBut yes, there **are** situations where the `for...else` pattern in Python is genuinely helpful. The best example is when you’re **searching** for something in a list.\n\n### Example: Searching With `for...else`\n\nLet’s say you want to check if the number 10 is in your `numbers` list:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [5, 8, 12]\n\nfor number in numbers:\n    if number == 10:\n        print(\"Found 10!\")\n        break  # Exit the loop as soon as we find 10\nelse:\n    print(\"10 not found!\")\n```\n\n**What happens:**\n- Python loops through the list.\n- If it finds 10, it prints `\"Found 10!\"` and exits the loop with `break`.\n- If it goes through the whole list and **doesn’t** find 10 (the loop wasn’t stopped by `break`), **then** the `else` part runs, printing `\"10 not found!\"`.\n\n#### Try it With These Lists:\n\n**1. Number is Present:**\n```python\nnumbers = [5, 8, 10, 12]\n```\nOutput:\n```\nFound 10!\n```\n(The loop finds 10, prints the message, and does **not** run the `else`.)\n\n**2. Number is Absent:**\n```python\nnumbers = [5, 8, 12]\n```\nOutput:\n```\n10 not found!\n```\n(The loop never finds 10, so after it finishes, the `else` block runs.)\n\n---\n\n### Why is this useful?\n- The `for...else` structure is great for search situations:  \n  - If what you’re looking for is found, you use `break`, and `else` won’t run.\n  - If it’s not found after checking every item, only then does `else` run.\n\n---\n\nSo, for showing “No items found!” when a list is empty, use `if not numbers:`.\nFor search-type situations where you want to know whether something was found in a loop, `for...else` can be really handy.\n\nWould you like to try a small search example yourself with `for...else`? Or maybe you have another type of loop you want to explore?"

The range function in Python is exclusive of the stop value, so range(0, 10) goes up to 9 but does not include 10.

Suppose you want to take a list of numbers and only include their squares if the number is odd. Here's your list:\n\n```python\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nCan you write a list comprehension to create a list called odd_squares that contains the squares of only the odd numbers from nums?

They’re powerful because they let you combine looping, filtering, and even transformations into a single, readable line.\n\nWant to add an extra challenge? You can also use list comprehensions to transform each element. For example, try making a list where you add \"!\" to the end of every word that has exactly 3 letters from the words list:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"sun\", \"star\", \"galaxy\", \"moon\", \"sky\", \"planet\"]\n```\n\nSee if you can write a list comprehension for that!"

Here are a couple of ideas that combine what you know and add a little twist:\n\n**Idea 1 — Nested List Comprehension:**   \nSuppose you have a list of numbers, and you want a list of lists, where each sublist contains the multiples of that number up to 3 times. For example, for [1, 2, 3], you’d want:  \n[[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nnums = [1, 2, 3]\nmultiples = [[num * i for i in range(1, 4)] for num in nums]\n```\n\n**Idea 2 — Tuple List Comprehension:**  \nYou can also build lists of tuples. For instance, make a list of (word, length) pairs for all the words from our previous words list that have more than 3 letters.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nwords = [\"sun\", \"star\", \"galaxy\", \"moon\", \"sky\", \"planet\"]\nword_lengths = [(word, len(word)) for word in words if len(word) > 3]\n```\n\n**Challenge for you:**  \nCan you write a list comprehension that takes this list of numbers:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\n\nand creates a list of the string \"even\" for even numbers and \"odd\" for odd numbers?  \nSo, your result should look like:  \n[\"odd\", \"even\", \"odd\", \"even\", ..., \"even\"]\n\nGive it a try! If you get stuck, I’ll provide a gentle hint."

Let’s dive into more advanced list comprehensions using multiple for-loops, which is also called a “nested list comprehension.”\n\n### Multiple for-loops in a List Comprehension\n\nWhen you have more than one for keyword inside your list comprehension brackets, Python loops through each combination, just like nested for-loops.\n\n#### Example 1: All possible pairs (cartesian product)  \nSuppose you have two lists:\n\n```python\ncolors = [\"red\", \"green\"]\nobjects = [\"apple\", \"leaf\"]\n```\n\nIf you wanted a list of all possible combinations, with each color paired with each object, you could do this:\n\n```python\npairs = [(color, obj) for color in colors for obj in objects]\n```\n\nThis will give:\n\n```python\n[('red', 'apple'), ('red', 'leaf'), ('green', 'apple'), ('green', 'leaf')]\n```\n\n#### Example 2: The multiplication table (1–3)  \nLet’s say you want a flat list of all the products of numbers 1–3, multiplied by 1–3:\n\n```python\nproducts = [i * j for i in range(1, 4) for j in range(1, 4)]\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```python\n[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 6, 9]\n```\n\nIf you want a table (list of lists) instead, you can nest comprehensions:\n\n```python\ntable = [[i * j for j in range(1, 4)] for i in range(1, 4)]\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```python\n[[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]\n```\n\n#### Example 3: Flattening a nested list  \nSuppose you have a list of lists (a matrix):\n\n```python\nmatrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n```\n\nYou can flatten it into a single list using a double for-loop in your list comprehension:\n\n```python\nflat = [num for row in matrix for num in row]\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```python\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n```\n\n---\n\n**Your turn!**\nTry making a list of all two-letter combinations using these two lists of letters:\n\n```python\nfirst = ['a', 'b']\nsecond = ['x', 'y']\n```\n\nEach combination should be a two-character string (like \"ax\", \"ay\", \"bx\", \"by\"). Can you write the list comprehension for it?"

You used two for-loops inside the list comprehension to generate every possible combination of a letter from first with a letter from second.\n\n**What you just did is the same as:**\n```python\ncombinations = []\nfor f in first:\n    for s in second:\n        combinations.append(f + s)\n```\nBut with a much shorter, cleaner expression.\n\nWould you like to try combining a double for-loop and an if condition? For example:  \nCan you make a list of all two-digit numbers using digits 1–3 for both the tens and ones place, but only include numbers where the digits are not equal (so 11, 22, and 33 are skipped)? The result should be: [12, 13, 21, 23, 31, 32].\n\nWant to give it a shot?"
