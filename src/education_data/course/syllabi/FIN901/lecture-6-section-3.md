Debt is money that you owe to others. It is classified by its source and purpose.

### 1. Credit Card Debt

- **Revolving debt:** You can borrow up to a limit and pay it back either fully or partially each month.
- **Interest:** Unpaid balances accrue interest at high rates (sometimes 20%+ annually).
- **Pros:** Convenience and rewards; can improve credit if managed properly.
- **Cons:** Easy to rack up high-interest debt.

**Example:**  
If you charge $1,000 to a credit card with a 20% annual interest rate and only pay the minimum each month, you'd accrue significant interest and could take years to pay it off.

### 2. Loans

#### a. **Personal Loans**

- Typically installment loans (fixed payments for a set term)
- Used for many purposes (consolidating debt, emergencies, home improvements)
- Interest rates vary based on creditworthiness

#### b. **Auto Loans**

- Used for purchasing vehicles
- Typically secured (the car is collateral)

#### c. **Student Loans**

- Used to pay for education
- May have favorable terms (lower interest, deferred payment options)

#### d. **Mortgages**

- Used to buy a home
- Long-term, secured by the property
