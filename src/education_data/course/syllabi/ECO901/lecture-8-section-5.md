During the 2008-2009 crisis, many countries enacted large fiscal stimulus packages to counteract declining private demand. This included:

- Tax cuts and direct payments to households
- Increased social spending

Studies showed that these policies helped stem deeper recessions, but also contributed to rising public debts.
