Understanding interest rates and time value of money helps you:

- **Compare Savings Accounts:** Choose the account with the highest effective interest rate, considering compounding frequency.
- **Assess Loans:** Identify the true cost of borrowing by calculating total interest paid over time.
- **Plan Investments:** Evaluate how much an investment will grow or how much you need to save to reach a future goal.
- **Decide Between Options:** Compare a lump sum today versus payments in the future.

### Example: Credit Card Interest

Suppose you have a credit card balance of $2,000 at an annual interest rate of 18%, compounded monthly. If you do not pay it off for a year, how much would you owe?

- $P = 2,000$
- $r = 0.18$
- $n = 12$
- $t = 1$

$$
A = 2,000 \times (1 + 0.18/12)^{12} \approx 2,000 \times (1.015)^{12} \approx 2,000 \times 1.1956 = 2,391.20
$$

You would owe about $391.20 in interest after one year.
