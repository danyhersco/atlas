Suppose a sample of exam scores is:

[65, 68, 70, 70, 71, 71, 72, 73, 75, 80]

**Step 1: Central Tendency**
- Mean: $(65 + 68 + 70 + 70 + 71 + 71 + 72 + 73 + 75 + 80)/10 = 71.5$
- Median: (5th and 6th values) $(71 + 71)/2 = 71$
- Mode: 70, 71 (appear twice each)

**Step 2: Dispersion**
- Range: $80 - 65 = 15$
- Variance and Standard Deviation:
    - Differences from mean: [-6.5, -3.5, -1.5, -1.5, -0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 8.5]
    - Squares: [42.25, 12.25, 2.25, 2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, 12.25, 72.25]
    - Sum: 146.5
    - Variance: $146.5 / 9 = 16.28$
    - Std dev: $\sqrt{16.28} = 4.04$

**Step 3: Visualization**
- Histogram will show a peak around 70-73.
- Boxplot will reveal the spread and any outliers.
