**Case Study: Calculating the Cost of Credit Card Debt**

You have a credit card balance of $2,500 with an annual interest rate of 18%. If you make only the minimum payment of $50 per month, how long will it take you to pay off the balance, and how much total interest will you pay?

**Instructions:**
1. Write pseudocode or a simple program (Python or other language) to calculate the timeline and total interest paid.
2. Explain why making only minimum payments is not a good strategy.
