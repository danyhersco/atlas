Globalization has major implications for national macroeconomic policies:

### Open Economy Macroeconomics

- **Expanded IS-LM (the Mundell-Fleming Model):** Considers capital flows and exchange rates.
- Outcomes depend on whether the exchange rate is fixed or floating.

### Policy Effectiveness in a Globalized World

- **Fixed Exchange Rate:** Limits effectiveness of monetary policy.
- **Floating Exchange Rate:** Limits effectiveness of fiscal policy due to exchange rate adjustments.

#### Example

Suppose a country uses fiscal expansion (increased G). In a floating exchange rate regime:
- Higher interest rates attract capital inflows.
- Currency appreciates.
- Net exports fall, offsetting the fiscal expansion.

### Global Shocks

- Oil price changes, financial crises, and pandemics now transmit rapidly among countries.
- Supply chain dependencies can amplify shocks.

### Trade-offs

- Globalization allows for efficiency and growth but exposes economies to external risks.
- Policy space can be "imported" or "exported" via global financial flows (e.g., contagion during financial crisis).
