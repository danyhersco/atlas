Once you have goals, you must consistently make choices to support them. **Informed financial choices** are those based on facts, careful consideration, and analysis.

### The Decision-Making Process

A good decision-making process:

1. **Identify the Decision:** What must be decided? (e.g., “Should I buy a used or new car?”)
2. **Gather Information:** Collect relevant data (prices, warranties, running costs).
3. **Consider Options:** List alternatives and their pros/cons.
4. **Weigh the Evidence:** Evaluate each option based on your goals, values, and data.
5. **Choose:** Select the best option.
6. **Act:** Implement your choice.
7. **Review:** Assess the outcome and learn from any mistakes.

### Example: Choosing Between Two Job Offers

Suppose you receive two job offers:
- **Job A:** Higher salary but more hours.
- **Job B:** Lower salary, better work-life balance.

**Analysis Table:**

| Factor        | Job A        | Job B         |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Salary        | $60,000      | $50,000       |
| Weekly Hours  | 50           | 37            |
| Benefits      | Health, dental | Health only |
| Commute       | 10 minutes   | 40 minutes    |
| Growth        | High         | Moderate      |

Ask yourself:
- Which job aligns better with your current financial and personal goals?
- Are you prioritizing income or quality of life at this stage?
