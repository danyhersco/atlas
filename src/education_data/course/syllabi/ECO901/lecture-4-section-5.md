It is important to distinguish between short-run, cyclical movements in unemployment and its longer-term, “natural” rate.

### Short-Run Unemployment

- Subject to business cycles.
- Heavily influenced by changes in aggregate demand.
- Fluctuates above and below the natural rate.

**Illustration:** After a financial crisis, firms reduce hiring and lay off workers, leading to a sharp increase in cyclical unemployment.

### The Natural Rate of Unemployment

- The “normal” level of unemployment around which the actual rate fluctuates.
- Composed of frictional and structural unemployment.
- Exists even in a healthy, growing economy.
- Also known as the “full employment” rate of unemployment.

#### Why is Unemployment Never Zero?

Even in the best-performing economies, there is always some level of frictional and structural unemployment:

- People are always moving between jobs (frictional).
- Economy constantly changes, rendering some skills obsolete (structural).

### The Long-Run Perspective

In the long run, the natural rate of unemployment reflects labor market institutions, job search behavior, regulation, technology, and demographics. Policies aimed at reducing unemployment to zero are neither realistic nor desirable, as some turnover is welcomed and healthy.
