### Example 1: *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954, United States)

**Decision**: The Court unanimously held that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional.

**Reasoning**: The Court found that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal," overturning the “separate but equal” doctrine established in *Plessy v. Ferguson*.

**Impact**:
- Laid the foundation for the Civil Rights Movement.
- Triggered widespread educational and social reform.
- Demonstrated the role of the courts as protectors of rights and agents of social change.

#### Key Takeaway

**Reasoning**: The decision emphasized the need for laws to reflect fundamental rights and the spirit of equality enshrined in the Constitution.

**Impact**:

### Example 3: *A and Others v. Secretary of State for the Home Department* (2004, United Kingdom)

**Background**: The government detained foreign nationals without charge or trial under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.

**Reasoning**: The indefinite detention was found disproportionate and discriminatory, especially as it targeted non-citizens.

**Impact**:
- Required the government to amend its anti-terror laws.
- Affirmed the judiciary’s capacity to check executive power even in times of perceived crisis.

#### Key Takeaway

**Legal Issue**: Does Quebec have the unilateral right to secede under Canadian or international law?

**Reasoning**: Emphasized constitutional principles of federalism, democracy, the rule of law, and protection of minority rights.

**Impact**:
- Clarified the constitutional process of secession.
- Set a framework for negotiating complex political disputes within a legal order.

#### Key Takeaway
