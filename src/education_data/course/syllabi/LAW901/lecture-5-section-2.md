### What is Judicial Review?

**Judicial review** is the power of courts to examine the actions of the legislative and executive branches—such as statutes, executive orders, and administrative rules—and to determine their compatibility with the constitution. When a law or action is found to contravene the constitution, courts may invalidate it.

#### Example: Judicial Review in Action

Suppose Parliament passes a law restricting freedom of speech. An affected individual petitions the courts, arguing the law violates the constitution's free speech guarantee. The court examines the law and, if it finds a conflict, may declare the law "unconstitutional" and unenforceable.

### Modes of Constitutional Interpretation

Courts use various approaches to interpret constitutions and statutes:

- **Textualism:** Focusing on the plain meaning of the text.
- **Originalism:** Seeking the intent or understanding of the text when it was adopted.
- **Purposivism:** Interpreting provisions in light of their broader purpose.
- **Living Constitution:** Viewing the constitution as a dynamic document whose meaning evolves over time.

#### Example: Interpreting a Constitutional Right

Suppose a constitution guarantees a "right to privacy." In the digital age, courts must determine if this right protects email communications, medical records, or even DNA information. Courts may consider the text, the intent of framers, societal change, and the purpose behind the right.

### Judicial Review: Comparative Perspectives

Not all countries grant courts the same level of judicial review. Some have strong-form review (courts can strike down laws), while others practice weak-form review (courts can advise but not bind the legislature).

- **United States:** The Supreme Court has strong judicial review following *Marbury v. Madison*.
- **United Kingdom:** Courts can declare laws incompatible with the Human Rights Act, but Parliament retains sovereignty.
