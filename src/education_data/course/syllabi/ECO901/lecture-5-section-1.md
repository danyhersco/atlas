Welcome to Lecture 5 of ECO901: Macroeconomics—Growth and Fluctuations. In the past lectures, we've developed essential tools for measuring macroeconomic performance such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment. Today, we introduce one of the central frameworks for analyzing the economy as a whole: the Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply (AD-AS) model. 

The AD-AS model extends earlier concepts to explain:
- How national output (GDP), price levels (inflation), and unemployment are jointly determined.
- The causes of short-run macroeconomic fluctuations (the business cycle) and long-run growth.
