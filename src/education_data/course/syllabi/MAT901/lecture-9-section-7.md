**Scenario:** A juice company claims their bottles contain, on average, 500 ml of juice. A random sample of 10 bottles shows a mean of 490 ml and a sample standard deviation of 15 ml. Has the average changed?

1. **Hypotheses:**

   - $H_0$: $\mu = 500$
   - $H_A$: $\mu \neq 500$

2. **Significance Level:** $\alpha = 0.05$

3. **t-score:**
   $$
   t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{490 - 500}{15/\sqrt{10}} = \frac{-10}{4.74} \approx -2.11
   $$

4. **Degrees of freedom:** $n-1 = 9$

5. **p-value:** Look up the two-tailed p-value for $t = -2.11$ and 9 df (use a t-table or calculator). Suppose p-value $\approx 0.063$.

6. **Decision:** $p$-value $= 0.063 > 0.05$; fail to reject $H_0$.

7. **Conclusion:** No strong evidence that the mean volume is different from 500 ml.
