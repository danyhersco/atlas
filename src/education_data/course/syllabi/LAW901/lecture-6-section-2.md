Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided and shared between a central (national) authority and constituent political units (like states, provinces, or regions). Federal systems contrast with unitary systems, where power is concentrated in a single central government.

**Key Features of Federalism:**
- **Constitutionally Entrenched Division of Powers:** Federal systems enshrine the division of authority in a formal written constitution.
- **Legal Autonomy:** Both the central and regional governments have autonomous spheres of jurisdiction.
- **Direct Authority:** Citizens are subject to laws made both by the national government and by their regional governments.
- **Arbitration Mechanisms:** Courts, often supreme or constitutional courts, resolve disputes over power distribution.

### Examples of Federal States

**Contrast:** The United Kingdom, France, and Japan are largely unitary, with central governments holding primary power (even if they devolve some authority to local governments).
