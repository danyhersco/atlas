Suppose:
- Population has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
- We take samples of size $n$ and compute the mean $\bar{x}$ for each sample

The set of all possible $\bar{x}$ from all possible samples of size $n$ forms the *sampling distribution of the mean*.

### Key Properties

- **Mean of the sampling distribution**: $\mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu$ (same as the population mean)
- **Standard deviation of the sampling distribution (standard error)**:
  $$
  \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$
  where $n$ is the sample size.

- As **sample size increases**, the standard error decreases: sample means are closer to the true mean.
