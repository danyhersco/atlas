A **business cycle** refers to the fluctuations in economic activity that an economy experiences over time. These cycles are characterized by periods of expansion and contraction in GDP, employment, and other macroeconomic variables.

### Four Main Phases

1. **Expansion (Recovery)**
   - Economic activity increases.
   - Output, income, employment, and consumer spending rise.
   - Usually accompanied by increasing investment and consumer confidence.

2. **Peak**
   - The end of the expansion phase.
   - Maximum output is reached.
   - The economy is typically at or near full employment; inflation may start to rise.

3. **Contraction (Recession)**
   - Economic activity slows down.
   - GDP, employment, and spending decrease.
   - Investments decline and consumer confidence drops.
   - If severe and prolonged, called a **depression**.

4. **Trough**
   - The lowest point of economic activity.
   - Marks the end of the recession.
   - Signals the beginning of the next expansion phase.
