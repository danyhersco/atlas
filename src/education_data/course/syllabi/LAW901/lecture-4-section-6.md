Consider the following scenario in a hypothetical country:

- The Parliament passes a new statute restricting press freedoms.
- The President publicly opposes the law but lacks veto power in this system.
- The Supreme Court reviews a case challenging the law as unconstitutional.

**Question:** Which branch, using which mechanisms, is exercising a check or balance here? Discuss possible outcomes.

**Discussion:**
- The Parliament has legislative initiative and authority.
- The President, lacking direct veto, may use public influence but cannot block the law.
- The Supreme Court (judiciary), exercising judicial review, may prevent the implementation of an unconstitutional law.
