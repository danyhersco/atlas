It’s not a keyword, but it’s the name of a built-in function. If you create a variable called `print`, you “overwrite” the function, so `print()` stops working as expected in your code.\n\nLet’s cement your understanding:\nIf you wanted to test if a certain string is a valid Python variable name, what built-in method could you use?

For code that’s crystal clear, well-named, and basic, you can usually skip a comment. \n\nLet’s practice: Would you add a comment to this line, or not?

You’ve used built-in ones, like `sin()` or `log()`—now you’ll write your own!\n\nTake a look at this basic function example:\n\n```python\ndef ball_height(v0, t, g=9.81):\n    \"\"\"Function to calculate and return height of the ball in vertical motion.\"\"\"\n    height = v0 * t - 0.5 * g * t**2\n    return height\n```\n\nHere are a couple questions to help you get started:\n- What does the `def` keyword do?\n- And, what do you think is the difference between writing this function and just putting `height = v0 * t - 0.5 * g * t**2` directly in your code, without a function?\n\nStart with those, and we’ll go step by step!"

With a function, I can use different values by calling the function with different arguments, but just writing the equation wouldn’t let me reuse it easily—or something like that?

You’re absolutely right:  \n- `def` does exactly that—it tells Python a new function is about to be defined.\n- And your intuition about reusability is spot on. With a function, you set up a reusable “machine” for calculation. You can call it many times with different inputs, instead of rewriting or copy-pasting the formula for each case.\n\nImagine you have to calculate the ball’s height *many* times for different velocities and times. Would a function or a single equation written over and over be easier and less error-prone? Why?\n\nAlso, does the function in the example actually *do* anything just by being defined, or is something else needed for the calculation to happen?"

If you don’t specify `g` when calling the function, Python uses `9.81` automatically.\n\nCan you guess what happens if you call:\n```python\nball_height(5, 0.5)\n```\nversus:\n```python\nball_height(5, 0.5, 10)\n```\nWhat values will `g` be in each?

You’re really thinking this through.\n\nHere’s a tip: Python does allow you to use *named arguments* (keywords) in any order, as long as you provide all required ones. So yes, `ball_height(t=2, v0=10)` will work—Python matches the names, not the order.\n\nBut with `ball_height(10, t=2)`, the rules are stricter. Python first fills positional arguments left to right, so it puts `10` into `v0`. Then it sees `t=2` as a named argument for `t`, which is fine. However, you *cannot* use a keyword argument before a positional argument (like this: `ball_height(v0=10, 2)`)—Python would raise a syntax error.\n\nThe safest way? Always put positional arguments first, and after that, keyword arguments.  \nFor example:\n- `ball_height(10, 2)` (all positional, fine)\n- `ball_height(10, 2, g=10)` (positional, then keyword, fine)\n- `ball_height(v0=10, t=2)` or `ball_height(t=2, v0=10)` (all keyword, order doesn’t matter)\n\nWould you like to try writing a function yourself?

If $s$ gets smaller, the denominator shrinks, so the peak gets higher and the curve gets narrower—kind of “taller and thinner.” The $\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ part keeps things normalized so that the total area under the curve stays at 1, no matter the value of $s$."

For example:\n```python\ncounter = 0\nwhile counter <= 10:\n    counter = counter + 1\n\nprint(counter)\n```\nIn this example, notice how the indented lines are *inside* the loop and get repeated.

So you understood that part perfectly!\n\nHere’s an example of what happens:\n```python\ncounter = 0\nwhile counter <= 10:\ncounter = counter + 1\nprint(counter)\n```\nWhen Python sees this, it will complain something like:\n```\nIndentationError: expected an indented block\n```\nWhy do you think Python insists on indentation for things inside a `while` loop (or a function)?  \nCan you explain in your own words why we need to indent the code in these situations?"

Here’s one:  \nWrite a Python function `num_digits(a)` that uses a `while` loop to count how many decimal digits are needed to write a positive integer $a$. For example, for $a = 73$, you’d get $2$ digits; for $12345$, you’d get $5$.\n\nWhat do you think your main loop condition should check for in this function?"

What do you think happens to $a$ each time? And how would you use another variable to keep track of the digit count?\n\nTry sketching out the steps or pseudocode for this approach. What variables would you need, and how would they change on each loop iteration?"

When `a` becomes 0, I’d stop.\n\nSo, kind of like:\n\n- set `count = 0`\n- while `a > 0`:\n    - add 1 to `count`\n    - divide `a` by 10 (integer division)\n- finish, and `count` is the answer\n\nIs that on the right track?"

Could you try writing out the function `num_digits(a)` with these steps?

We’ll use list comprehensions to approximate $\\pi$ using the Gregory-Leibniz series.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nCan you think of a way to use a list comprehension to generate the first $n$ odd numbers?  \n(Hint: For $n = 5$, the first five odd numbers are $1, 3, 5, 7, 9$.
