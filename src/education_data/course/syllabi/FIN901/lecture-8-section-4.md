Financial decisions often have an ethical dimension. Ethics in finance involves **acting with honesty, integrity, and fairness**, not just following the law.

### Personal Ethics Scenarios

- **Claiming False Information:** Falsifying income on a loan application is illegal and unethical.
- **Insider Trading:** Using confidential information to make investment decisions is unfair and often illegal.

### Everyday Ethical Questions

- Should you “help out” a friend by cosigning a loan if you’re not sure you can cover the debt?
- Is it acceptable to withhold information from a partner in joint financial decisions?
- How should you react to a billing error in your favor?

**Guidance:** Think about the impact of your decision on others, reputational risks, and how you would feel if your actions were made public.

### The Role of Ethics in Building Trust

Ethical behavior builds creditworthiness and personal relationships. Violations can cost financially (e.g., lawsuits, fines) and damage trust.
