Public law refers to the body of law that governs the relationship between individuals and the state, as well as the structure and operation of government itself. Its origins can be traced to ancient civilizations, where early forms of governance and codification of laws began.

### Ancient Legal Systems

**Mesopotamia:**  
- The Code of Hammurabi (circa 1754 BCE) is one of the earliest known written legal codes. It laid out rules and penalties for various offences, setting a precedent for state-defined laws.

**Ancient Greece and Rome:**
- *Greece*: Concepts like _isonomia_ (equal law) and public participation in Athens’ democracy influence modern ideas of governance and public accountability.
- *Rome*: The _Twelve Tables_ (5th century BCE) and later the _Corpus Juris Civilis_ (6th century CE, under Emperor Justinian) formed the backbone of Roman law and influenced European legal systems for centuries.

### Religion and Law

- **Canon Law:** Medieval Europe developed a complex set of church laws that often intersected with secular authorities.
- **Islamic Law (Sharia):** In Islamic empires, a blend of religious and public law structured society and influenced governance.
