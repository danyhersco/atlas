This session covered the essential macroeconomic models that underpin contemporary policy debates and their relevance for interpreting recent trends and challenges. Equipped with the Keynesian Cross, IS-LM, AD–AS, Solow, and open economy frameworks, you are now able to:

- Map real-world events onto macroeconomic models.
- Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of policy responses in a globalized context.
- Analyze and forecast macroeconomic outcomes in an interconnected world.

Next time, we will dive deeper into current debates and the frontiers of macroeconomic research.
