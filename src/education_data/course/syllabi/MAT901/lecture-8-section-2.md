A **point estimate** is a single numerical value used to estimate an unknown population parameter.

**Example:**
- Suppose we want to estimate the average height of all students at a university.
    - The population mean (true value) is unknown.
    - We take a random sample of 100 students and calculate their mean height (e.g., 170.2 cm). This sample mean is a *point estimate* for the population mean.

**Common Point Estimators:**
- The sample mean $\bar{x}$ estimates the population mean $\mu$.
- The sample proportion $\hat{p}$ estimates the population proportion $p$.
- The sample variance $s^2$ estimates the population variance $\sigma^2$.

**Notation Recap:**
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$
- Sample proportion: $\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n}$, where $x$ = number of successes in $n$ trials

**Properties of Good Estimators:**
- **Unbiased:** The estimator's expected value equals the parameter.
- **Consistent:** As sample size increases, the estimator converges to the parameter.
- **Efficient:** The estimator has smaller variance among all unbiased estimators.
