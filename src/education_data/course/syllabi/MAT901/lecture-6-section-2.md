Understanding the **type of data** you’re working with is essential, because it guides which statistical analyses and visualizations are appropriate.

### 1. Qualitative (Categorical) Data

- **Nominal:** Categories with no logical order (e.g., colors: red, green, blue).
- **Ordinal:** Categories with an inherent order, but intervals between values are not meaningful (e.g., grades: A, B, C, D).

### 2. Quantitative (Numerical) Data

- **Discrete:** Countable values, often integers (e.g., number of students in a class).
- **Continuous:** Any value within a range, often measured (e.g., height, weight, time).

#### Examples

| Days absent           | Quantitative | Discrete     |
