Economists use several statistical indicators to track and predict the business cycle. These indicators can be classified as:

- **Leading Indicators**: Predict future movement (e.g., stock market returns, new orders for durable goods, building permits).
- **Coincident Indicators**: Move simultaneously with the overall economy (e.g., GDP, income, employment).
- **Lagging Indicators**: Change after the economy has already begun a new trend (e.g., unemployment rate, corporate profits).

### Example Indicators

- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** (Coincident): Measures the value of all goods and services produced.
- **Unemployment Rate** (Lagging): Rises after the economy has entered a recession; falls after expansion is underway.
- **Consumer Confidence Index** (Leading): Changes before the economy as a whole moves in a new direction.
