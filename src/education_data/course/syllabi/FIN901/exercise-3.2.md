**Track Your Spending**

Over the next seven days, record all of your expenses. At the end of the week:

- Categorize your spending (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).
- Compare your actual spending with your budgeted amounts.
- Identify at least one area for improvement and suggest a plan.
