Economists use statistical indices to measure inflation. The two most widely used are the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI).

### Consumer Price Index (CPI)

The **CPI** measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a fixed basket of consumer goods and services.

#### Steps in Calculating CPI

1. **Select a Base Year and Basket of Goods**: Identify a representative basket of goods and services purchased by typical consumers.
2. **Find Prices**: Determine current prices for all items in the basket.
3. **Calculate Cost of Basket**: Multiply quantities by prices, sum over all goods.
4. **Construct CPI**:
   $$
   \text{CPI}_t = \frac{\text{Cost of Basket in Year } t}{\text{Cost of Basket in Base Year}} \times 100
   $$
5. **Calculate Inflation**:
   $$
   \text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{\text{CPI}_{t} - \text{CPI}_{t-1}}{\text{CPI}_{t-1}} \times 100\%
   $$

**Example**:  
Suppose the basket costs $200 in 2022 (base year), and $210 in 2023.
- $CPI_{2022} = 200/200 \times 100 = 100$
- $CPI_{2023} = 210/200 \times 100 = 105$
- Inflation Rate $= (105 - 100)/100 \times 100\% = 5\%$

#### Uses and Limitations of the CPI

- Used to *index* wages and social security payments, and as a measure of cost of living.
- **Limitations**:
  - Substitution bias: The fixed basket doesn't account for consumers switching to cheaper goods.
  - Introduction of new goods.
  - Quality changes.
  - May not reflect individual household experiences.

### Producer Price Index (PPI)

The **PPI** measures average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output. It is an indicator of price trends at an earlier stage in the production process.

#### Uses

- Seen as an early warning indicator of future consumer price inflation.
- Useful for businesses in planning and contract adjustments.

**Example**:  
If producer prices for steel rise, this might eventually show up as higher prices for cars (consumer goods).

### Core Inflation

**Core Inflation** is an adjusted measure that removes volatile items such as food and energy prices from the CPI or PPI, providing a clearer view of the underlying trend.
