Democracy is not self-executing; it depends on robust legal structures to function effectively and fairly. Key democratic processes must be actively safeguarded through legal mechanisms.

### Key Aspects of Democratic Safeguards

1. **Free and Fair Elections**
   - Laws regulating campaign finance, media access, and vote counting are essential for elections' integrity.
   - Example: The use of independent electoral commissions to prevent government interference.

2. **Political Rights and Civil Freedoms**
   - Public law enshrines rights such as freedom of expression, assembly, and association, which are vital for pluralism and contestation.

3. **Transparency and Access to Information**
   - Laws requiring open government, disclosure of political financing, and media freedom empower the public to scrutinize power.

4. **Impartial Administration**
   - Rules against corruption, abuse of office, and discrimination support equal participation.

### Legal Tools to Protect Democracy

- **Judicial Review**: Courts can invalidate laws or government actions that infringe on democratic norms.
- **Ombudsman Institutions**: Provide avenues for grievances concerning public administration.

#### Case Study: South Africa’s Independent Electoral Commission

After apartheid, South Africa established an autonomous body to oversee elections, enshrined in the Constitution and protected by public law statutes, providing credibility to the nascent democracy.
