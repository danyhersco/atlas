The distinction between public and private law is fundamental in legal theory:

- **Public Law:** Involves interactions between individuals and the state, or the functioning of the state itself.
    - Examples: Constitutional law, criminal law, administrative law.
- **Private Law:** Deals with legal relationships between private individuals or organizations.
    - Examples: Contract law, tort law, property law.

| Main Parties  | Individuals vs. State | Private Parties (Individuals/Organizations) |
| Purpose       | Regulate society, uphold public interest | Protect individual interests and resolve disputes |
