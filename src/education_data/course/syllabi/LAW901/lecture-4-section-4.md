The doctrine of checks and balances supplements the separation of powers by enabling each branch to limit the power of the others, ensuring no branch dominates the government.

### Examples

- **Legislature checks Executive:** Impeachment, budgetary control, approval of appointments.
- **Executive checks Legislature:** Veto power, ability to call special sessions.
- **Judiciary checks both:** Judicial review, power to declare laws or executive actions unconstitutional.

**Case Example (United States):**

- **Marbury v. Madison (1803):** Established the power of judicial review.
- **U.S. Presidential Veto:** President vetoes legislation, but Congress can override with supermajority.
