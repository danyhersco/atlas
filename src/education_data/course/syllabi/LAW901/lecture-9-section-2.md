Public law comes to life in the courts, where theoretical principles are translated into practical decisions. Choosing cases to analyze involves several factors:

- **Legal Significance**: Was the case pivotal in changing or clarifying the law?
- **Institutional Impact**: Did the case affect how public bodies operate?
- **Societal Influence**: What real-world consequences did the decision have?
- **Rights and Accountability**: Did the case advance, limit, or protect fundamental rights?

An effective case analysis involves:
1. **Background**: What were the facts and legal questions?
2. **Legal Issues**: What constitutional or legal principles were at stake?
3. **Decision**: How did the court rule, and why?
4. **Reasoning**: Which arguments and precedents guided the decision?
5. **Impact**: What were the consequences for law, institutions, and society?

Let's explore this methodology with a range of examples.
