In this lecture, we bridge the foundational principles of macroeconomic measurement and policy from previous weeks with the practical and theoretical frameworks used to analyze entire economies. We will:

- Introduce key macroeconomic models.
- Discuss the use of these models in evaluating the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy.
- Examine recent macroeconomic trends, including in the post-pandemic period.
- Analyze the impact of globalization on national economies and macroeconomic policy.

By the end of this session, students should be able to explain the central macroeconomic models that shape policy debates, interpret major economic trends, and understand how global interdependence reshapes national macroeconomic outcomes.
