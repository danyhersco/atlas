Financial decision making starts with **setting clear and meaningful goals**. These goals form the foundation for all your subsequent financial choices.

### What Are Financial Goals?

Financial goals are specific objectives you aim to achieve with your money. They provide direction and aid motivation. Goals may be **short-term** (within the next year), **medium-term** (1-5 years), or **long-term** (over 5 years).

#### Examples

- **Short-term:** Save $500 for a new laptop in 8 months.
- **Medium-term:** Build a $10,000 emergency fund in 3 years.
- **Long-term:** Accumulate $300,000 for retirement over 35 years.

### SMART Goals

Effective financial goals are **SMART**:
- **S**pecific: States exactly what you want to achieve.
- **M**easurable: Quantifiable, so you know when you’ve succeeded.
- **A**chievable: Realistic, given your resources.
- **R**elevant: Aligned with your personal values and life situation.
- **T**ime-bound: Has a deadline or time horizon.

#### Example

Bad: “I want to be rich.”
Good: “I will save $1,000 in a high-yield account by December 31 to cover car repairs.”

### Steps to Setting Financial Goals

1. **Reflect:** Consider what's important to you (security, freedom, experiences).
2. **List:** Write down all goals, big and small.
3. **Prioritize:** Rank them by urgency and importance.
4. **Break down:** Split larger goals into actionable steps.
5. **Review:** Revisit and adjust goals as your circumstances change.
