**Insurance Scenario Analysis**

You're offered the following auto insurance plans:

1. Plan A: $400/year premium, $1,000 deductible
2. Plan B: $700/year premium, $500 deductible

Assume you expect to file a single claim of $2,500 this year.

- Calculate the total cost (premium plus deductible) for each plan **if you do make a claim** and **if you do not make a claim**.
- Which plan is better if you expect to make a claim this year? Which if you expect not to? Show your reasoning.
