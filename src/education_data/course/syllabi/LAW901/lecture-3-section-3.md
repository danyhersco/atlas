**Constitutionalism** refers to the idea that government derives its authority from a higher law—namely, the constitution—and that governmental power must be exercised within legal and institutional constraints.

### Key Principles:

1. **Rule of Law:**  
   Every action of government and its officials must be based in law, not arbitrary will. No one, including leaders, is above the law.

2. **Separation of Powers:**  
   Divides government into distinct branches (legislative, executive, judicial), each with its own functions and checks on the others.

   Example: In the US, Congress (legislative) makes laws, the President (executive) enforces them, and the Supreme Court (judicial) interprets them.
   ```

3. **Checks and Balances:**  
   Mechanisms by which each branch of government can limit the powers of the others, preventing tyranny.

4. **Protection of Fundamental Rights:**  
   Constitutions often codify rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and due process, shielding citizens from government overreach.

5. **Popular Sovereignty:**  
   The authority of government derives from the people, usually expressed through elections and other forms of participation.
