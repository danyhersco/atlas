Saving is the foundation of sound financial management. It allows individuals to prepare for unexpected expenses, pursue financial goals, and achieve long-term security.

### Why Save?

- **Emergency Preparedness:** Life is unpredictable. Medical emergencies, job loss, or urgent repairs can arise. Savings act as a buffer.
- **Financial Goals:** Saving enables purchasing a home, traveling, starting a business, or planning for retirement.
- **Freedom from Debt:** With savings, you're less likely to rely on high-interest debt for emergencies.
- **Peace of Mind:** Knowing you have funds set aside reduces stress about the future.

### Example: The Cost of Not Saving

Imagine two friends, Alex and Sam. Both face a $1,000 car repair bill.

- **Alex** has saved $1,200 in an emergency fund—pays immediately, no debt.
- **Sam** has no savings—puts the $1,000 on a credit card with 20% annual interest and pays $50 monthly.

Let’s calculate Sam’s total cost:

- $1,000 at 20% annual interest, paying $50/month:
    - It would take approximately 24 months to pay off, accruing about $215 in interest, for a total of $1,215.
- Alex pays $1,000 from savings, with $200 left, no extra costs.

This demonstrates how saving prevents debt and extra expenses.
