Even well-intentioned plans can be undermined by common **financial pitfalls**—mistakes or risky behaviors that compromise financial wellbeing.

### Common Financial Pitfalls

#### 1. **Impulse Buying**

Making unplanned purchases without considering their impact. 

**Example:** Seeing a new phone advertised and buying it immediately with a credit card, even though your current phone works fine and you haven’t saved for the new one.

**Strategy to Avoid:** Use the “24-Hour Rule”—wait one day before making discretionary purchases.

#### 2. **Overusing Credit**

Relying too much on credit cards or loans, leading to high-interest debts.

**Warning Signs:**
- Only making minimum payments
- Reaching or exceeding credit limits

**Prevention:** Budget for purchases and only borrow what you can repay quickly.

#### 3. **Not Saving for Emergencies**

Unexpected expenses (car repairs, medical bills) can derail financial plans if you don’t have a cushion.

**Solution:** Prioritize an emergency fund (as discussed in Lecture 4).

#### 4. **Ignoring the Impact of Small Expenses**

Regular “small” outlays can add up. 

**Example:** Spending $4 on coffee every weekday ($4 * 5 days * 52 weeks = $1,040 per year).

**Tip:** Track your expenses to identify and control leaks.

#### 5. **Falling for Investment Scams and Predatory Products**

Promises of “guaranteed high returns” or pressure sales should be warning signs.

**Prevention:** Always research investments and use reputable sources.
