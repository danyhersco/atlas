**Uniform distributions** are the simplest continuous or discrete probability distributions, where every value in the support has equal probability.

### Discrete Uniform Distribution

- Rolling a fair die: $P(X = k) = 1/6$ for $k = 1,2,3,4,5,6$

### Continuous Uniform Distribution

If $X$ is uniformly distributed over $[a, b]$:

- **PDF**: $f(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}$ for $a \leq x \leq b$
- **Mean**: $E[X] = \frac{a + b}{2}$
- **Variance**: $Var(X) = \frac{(b - a)^2}{12}$

### Example

Random real number between 0 and 1: $f(x) = 1$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1$.
