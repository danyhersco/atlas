Random variables come in two types: **discrete** and **continuous**.

### Discrete Random Variables

- Take on a countable number of possible values.
- Common examples: number of heads in a series of coin tosses, the number rolled on a die.

**Example:**  
Let $X$ be the outcome when rolling a fair six-sided die.  
Possible values: $X \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$

### Continuous Random Variables

- Take on values in a continuous range or interval.
- Common examples: the exact height of a person, the time it takes for a reaction to complete.

**Example:**  
Let $Y$ be the time (in seconds) it takes for a certain chemical reaction to occur.  
Possible values: $Y \in [0, \infty)$
