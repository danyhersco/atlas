A budget is a *living document*—it should evolve as your circumstances and goals do.

### Common Reasons to Adjust Your Budget

- **Income changes** (raise, job loss, new job)
- **Changing goals** (decide to save for a car, start a family, pay off debt faster)
- **Unexpected expenses** (medical bills, car repairs)
- **Regular cost increases** (rent, utilities)

### How to Adjust

- Re-evaluate your spending habits.
- Shift money from less important categories to higher priorities.
- Consider changing your timeline for goals, if necessary.
- Look for ways to increase income or decrease spending.

**Example**:

If after tracking for three months you notice your grocery spending is $260/month, but you only budgeted $200, you’ll need to either cut back or allocate more to groceries in your budget.
