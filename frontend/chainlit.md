# Welcome to Atlas Dev Mode!

In here, you play the role of "Dany", a student enrolled in a set of modules. You have access to a personalised tutor for each of the university module he is enrolled in. They are aware of the course material, the learner, and will serve as a guide for optimising you learning experience. It also tracks your progress across sessions!
