This course will guide you through critical foundations of public law, examining:
- **Constitutional principles:** Origins and structures of government, rights and freedoms.
- **Administrative law:** How public bodies make decisions, and how those decisions can be challenged.
- **Criminal law (basics):** How society defines criminal acts and prosecutes offenders.
- **Public law’s impact on society:** Exploring issues of justice, equality, and the relationship between law and social change.

We will use case studies from both current events and historical developments to illustrate these themes.
