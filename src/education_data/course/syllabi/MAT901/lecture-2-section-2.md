Different relationships can exist between events:

### 1. **Simple Event**

Contains only one outcome.  
Example: Rolling a 3 on a die, $E = \{3\}$

### 2. **Compound Event**

Contains more than one outcome.
Example: Rolling an even number, $E = \{2, 4, 6\}$

### 3. **Mutually Exclusive Events**

Two events that cannot both happen at the same time.  
Example: On a die, $E_1 =$ rolling an odd number, $E_2 =$ rolling an even number. $E_1$ and $E_2$ are mutually exclusive.

### 4. **Exhaustive Events**

A set of events is exhaustive if one of them must occur. The collection covers the entire sample space.

### 5. **Independent Events**

Occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other.
Example: Toss two coins. Outcome of the first toss does not influence the outcome of the second.

### 6. **Dependent Events**

Occurrence of one event affects the probability of the other.
