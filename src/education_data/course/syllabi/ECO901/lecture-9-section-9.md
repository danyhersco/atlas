Whenever banks receive additional reserves, they can lend out a portion, creating new deposits.

Suppose the reserve requirement is 10 percent:

- Bank receives $1,000 deposit, must keep $100 in reserve, can lend $900.
- The $900 loan will be deposited elsewhere; of this $900, $90 must be reserved, $810 can be lent, and so on.
- The **money multiplier** is calculated as:

$$
\text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{\text{Reserve Ratio}}
$$

In this case:

$$
\text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10
$$

So a $1,000 increase in reserves could, in theory, increase the money supply by up to $10,000.
