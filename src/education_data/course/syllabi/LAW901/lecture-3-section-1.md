A **constitution** is a foundational legal document or set of principles that establishes the framework of a government. It defines the structure, powers, and limits of governmental institutions, and lays out the fundamental rights and duties of citizens.

**Key Points:**
- Constitutions may be written (like the United States Constitution) or unwritten (like the British constitution, which is based on statutes, conventions, and legal documents).
- A constitution is the highest law of the land—any law that conflicts with it is typically considered invalid.

**Example:**  
The United States Constitution was adopted in 1787 and establishes the three branches of government (Legislative, Executive, Judicial), enumerates powers, and protects individual rights through amendments.
