In previous lectures, we learned how to describe data and the theoretical underpinnings of probability and random variables. We also discussed how sample means behave, especially as the sample size increases, and were introduced to the Central Limit Theorem. 

Today, we turn our focus to statistical inference: **how we use sample data to draw conclusions about unknown population parameters**. We will cover *estimation*—including both point and interval estimates—and learn how to construct and interpret **confidence intervals**.
