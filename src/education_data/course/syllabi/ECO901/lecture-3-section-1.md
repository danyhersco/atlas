Inflation is one of the central topics in macroeconomics and refers to the general increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It captures the rate at which the purchasing power of money declines: if inflation is positive, every dollar buys fewer goods and services than before.

- **Definition**: Inflation is the percentage rate of change in the general price level from one period to the next.
- **Key Idea**: Inflation does **not** refer to an increase in a specific price, but rather to the **overall** price level.

**Example**:  
If in 2023, a basket of goods costs $100 and in 2024 it costs $105, the inflation rate is:
$$
\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{105 - 100}{100} \times 100\% = 5\%
$$

### Types of Inflation

1. **Creeping (mild) inflation**: Low, steady rise in price level (e.g., 1-3% per year).
2. **Galloping inflation**: Rapid, often double- or triple-digit annual increases.
3. **Hyperinflation**: Extremely high, typically more than 50% per month, leading to collapse of the currency.
4. **Deflation**: The opposite of inflation; a sustained decrease in the general price level.
