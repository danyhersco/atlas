Business cycles have real impacts on people and the economy:

- **Employment**: Recessions bring higher unemployment; expansions bring job growth.
- **Output**: National output falls in contractions, rises in expansions.
- **Investment**: Firms cut investment in downturns, invest more when optimistic.
- **Inflation**: Can rise in booms (demand-pull inflation) and fall or even turn into deflation during busts.
- **Government Finances**: Tax revenues fall and social spending rises during recessions, potentially increasing deficits.

### Social Consequences

- Higher unemployment and business failures.
- Increased anxiety and reduced well-being among the population.
