In this lecture, you learned:
- The difference between point and interval estimates.
- How to construct and interpret confidence intervals for means and proportions.
- How sample size and confidence level affect interval width.

Confidence intervals are a foundation for most statistical inference tasks. Next time, we’ll explore hypothesis testing, which builds directly upon the concepts learned today.
