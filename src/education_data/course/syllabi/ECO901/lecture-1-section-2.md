Though both are part of economics, their scope and focus differ:

| Aspect               | Microeconomics             | Macroeconomics                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Focus                | Individual agents (firms, households) | The economy as a whole         |
| Topics               | Supply and demand in markets, consumer choice, production costs | GDP, inflation, unemployment, monetary and fiscal policy |
| Example Question     | What will happen to the price of coffee if the price of milk rises? | What leads to national economic growth?                |

### Analogy

Think of microeconomics as examining the trees, while macroeconomics is surveying the entire forest.
