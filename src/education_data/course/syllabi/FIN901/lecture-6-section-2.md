A credit score is a numerical representation of your creditworthiness, used by lenders to decide whether to give you credit and at what interest rate. The most common credit scoring model is the FICO score, which ranges from 300 to 850.

### Factors Affecting Credit Scores

- **Payment History (35%)**: Have you paid bills on time?
- **Amounts Owed (30%)**: How much of your credit limits are you using?
- **Length of Credit History (15%)**: How long have your credit accounts been open?
- **New Credit (10%)**: Have you recently opened new credit accounts?
- **Credit Mix (10%)**: Do you have a variety of credit types (credit cards, loans, etc.)?

**Example Calculation:**  
If you have a perfect payment history, low balances (using under 30% of your limits), long-standing accounts, few recent credit inquiries, and a mix of credit types, you'll likely have a high score.

**Interpreting Credit Scores:**
- Excellent: 750-850
- Good: 700-749
- Fair: 650-699
- Poor: 600-649
- Very poor: below 600

- Determines eligibility and interest rates for loans and credit cards
- Affects renting an apartment, utility services, and sometimes employment
