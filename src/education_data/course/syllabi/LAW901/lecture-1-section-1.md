Public law forms the backbone of how a society organizes, governs, and regulates itself. While law, in general, is a system of rules created and enforced by social or governmental institutions, **public law** specifically refers to the legal frameworks that govern the relationship between individuals and the state, as well as the structures of government itself.

**Key Aspects of Public Law:**
- It is concerned with issues that affect the community at large.
- Encompasses constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law.
- Sets the rules for how government bodies must behave.
- Determines how power is distributed and exercised in a society.

**Example:**
If a person believes a government agency acted illegally by denying a public benefit (like social housing), they can challenge this decision through public law channels such as a judicial review.
