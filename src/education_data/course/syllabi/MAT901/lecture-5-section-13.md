Today, we explored several fundamental probability distributions:

- **Bernoulli and Binomial**: Model repeated experiments with two outcomes.
- **Poisson**: Model rare or random events in time or space.
- **Normal**: The go-to model for naturally occurring measures.
- **Uniform**: For situations with truly equal probability across the range.

Mastering when and how to use these distributions is crucial for probability and statistics. Refer to the exercises for practice and apply these concepts to real-world phenomena.
