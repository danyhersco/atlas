### Fiscal Deficits

A **budget deficit** occurs when government expenditures exceed tax revenues in a given period.

$$
\text{Deficit} = G - T \quad \text{(if } G > T \text{)}
$$

**Financing Deficits:**
- Borrowing by issuing government bonds
- Monetizing the deficit (less common; involves financing via central bank)

### Fiscal Surpluses

A **budget surplus** arises when tax revenues exceed government expenditures:

$$
\text{Surplus} = T - G \quad \text{(if } T > G \text{)}
$$

### Public Debt

The accumulated deficits (minus any surpluses) over time make up the **public or national debt**.

$$
\text{Debt}_{t} = \text{Debt}_{t-1} + \text{Deficit}_{t}
$$

Governments manage debt through further borrowing, refinancing, or by using surpluses to pay it down.

#### Debt-to-GDP Ratio

A common measure of a country's fiscal health is its **debt-to-GDP ratio**:

$$
\text{Debt-to-GDP Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Public Debt}}{\text{GDP}}
$$

A high ratio may raise concerns about fiscal sustainability and affect a nation's borrowing costs.

**Example:** In 2020, many countries saw their debt-to-GDP ratios rise sharply due to increased spending during the COVID-19 pandemic and declining tax revenues.
