To understand why business cycles occur, economists have proposed several theories:

### Classical Theory

- Assumes markets clear automatically; prices and wages adjust to restore equilibrium after shocks.
- Cycles are the result of temporary shocks (e.g., weather, technology).
- Little role for government intervention.

### Keynesian Theory

- Advocated by John Maynard Keynes.
- Argues that aggregate demand fluctuations cause business cycles.
- Prices and wages are "sticky" (slow to adjust).
- Supports the use of fiscal and monetary policy to stabilize the cycle.

### Monetarist Theory

- Associated with Milton Friedman.
- Argues that fluctuations in the money supply drive business cycles.
- Too much money causes booms; too little causes recessions.
- Advocates steady growth of money supply.

### Real Business Cycle (RBC) Theory

- Focuses on "real" shocks (technology, productivity, resource availability).
- Assumes flexible prices and rational expectations.
- Business cycles are efficient responses to real changes, not market imperfections.

### Austrian Theory

- Cycles arise from distortions in interest rates, usually because of inappropriate credit expansion by central banks.
- Emphasizes the role of malinvestments during booms that are corrected during busts.
