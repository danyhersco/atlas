Suppose in Country X, these are the data for the year:

- Total Consumer Spending ($C$): $300 billion
- Total Investment ($I$): $100 billion
- Government Purchases ($G$): $200 billion
- Export of Goods and Services ($X$): $80 billion
- Import of Goods and Services ($M$): $60 billion

Compute GDP using the expenditure approach:

$$
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M) = 300 + 100 + 200 + (80 - 60) = 620 \text{ billion dollars}
$$
