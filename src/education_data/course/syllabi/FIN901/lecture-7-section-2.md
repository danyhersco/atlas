There are many ways to invest. The most common types for individuals starting out are:

- **Stocks**
- **Bonds**
- **Mutual Funds**

Let's break each type down:

### Stocks

- **What is a stock?**
  - A stock is a share of ownership in a company. When you buy a company's stock, you become a part-owner (shareholder) of that company.
- **How do you make money?**
  - Through *dividends*: some companies periodically pay out part of their profits to shareholders.
  - Through *capital appreciation*: if the stock price rises and you sell your shares, you make a profit.
- **Example:** You buy 10 shares of Company A at $10 per share. If the share price rises to $15, and you sell all your shares, you make $(15 - 10) * 10 = $50.

### Bonds

- **What is a bond?**
  - A bond is a loan you make to a government or corporation. In exchange, they agree to pay you interest at intervals and return the initial loan amount (the principal) at the end of a fixed period (the maturity date).
- **How do you make money?**
  - Through *interest payments* (coupon payments).
- **Example:** You buy a $1,000 bond with a 5% annual interest rate and a 3-year term. Each year, you receive $50 in interest, and after 3 years, you get your $1,000 back.

### Mutual Funds

- **What is a mutual fund?**
  - A mutual fund pools money from many investors to buy a diversified group of stocks, bonds, or other securities, managed by professionals.
- **How do you make money?**
  - If the investments in the fund increase in value, your share of the fund becomes worth more. Some funds distribute dividends or interest income to investors.
- **Why use mutual funds?**
  - They offer diversification, professional management, and accessibility to a wide range of assets even with small amounts of money.
