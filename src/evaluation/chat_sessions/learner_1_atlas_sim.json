We'll use the formula for the position of a ball in vertical motion:\n\n$$ y(t) = v_0 t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$\n\nSay we have these values:\n- $v_0 = 5$ m/s (initial velocity)\n- $g = 9.81$ m/s² (gravity)\n- $t = 0.6$ s (time)\n\nFirst, before we write any code, can you spot what basic mathematical operations are involved in this formula?

What do you think happens to $y$ when $t$ is a very small number versus when $t$ gets larger? Want to try plugging in $t = 0$ and $t = 2$ to see which direction $y$ goes?"

You see how the upward part ($v_0 t$) helps the ball rise at first, but the downward part ($0.5 g t^2$) grows faster as $t$ increases? For small $t$, the ball is still going up—$y$ is positive or zero. As $t$ gets larger, gravity wins and $y$ becomes negative: the ball falls below its starting height.\n\nYou clearly understand both how to translate a formula to Python and what the result means physically!  \nReady to move on to the next concept, or do you have any last questions about coding math formulas?"

You use it for calculations with individual numbers (floats, ints).\n\nBut what do you think might happen if you try to use `math.sqrt()` or `math.log()` on a whole list or array of numbers?

If you were copying the formula everywhere, how many places would you need to fix?  \nAnd if you put the formula in a function instead—how many places would need your attention?\n\nAlso, think about sharing your code.

For single numbers, `math` works perfectly.\n\nCould you try sketching the function definition with `math` functions? For example, how would you write $\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ using the `math` module?

If you try, Python will complain with an error like:\n\n```python\nprint(height)  # NameError: name 'height' is not defined\n```\n\nWhy do you think Python doesn’t let you use variables from inside a function once the function finishes running?

Which value makes the condition false and ends the loop, causing the last value to be printed?\n\nFor indentation:  \n- Besides readability, can you think about what would happen if all the statements inside the loop are not indented?\n- Why do you think Python would need a way to tell which statements belong “inside” the loop?\n\nTry answering both—one for the value printed, and one about indentation’s purpose!"

Then it prints counter, so it prints 11? (I think? Or maybe it stopped one earlier… I’m not very sure!)\n\nFor indentation:  \nIf I don’t indent, maybe Python doesn’t know which lines are supposed to be repeated in the loop?
