**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** is the most widely used indicator for measuring the economic activity of a country. It represents the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period (usually one year or one quarter).

### GDP Definition

- **GDP:** The market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.

**Key elements of GDP:**
- **Market Value:** GDP uses market prices as weights to sum up all goods and services.
- **Final Goods and Services:** Only final goods are included, to avoid double counting. Intermediate goods are not counted separately.
- **Produced Within a Country:** GDP counts all output produced within a country's borders, regardless of the nationality of the producer.
- **Given Period:** It is always measured over a specific time frame.

### Methods of Calculating GDP

There are three main approaches to calculating GDP. In a well-functioning system, all approaches yield the same value.

#### 1. **Production (Output) Approach**

Adds up the market value of all final goods and services produced in the economy:

$$
GDP = \sum \text{Value of Final Output}
$$

#### 2. **Expenditure Approach**

Summarizes total spending on the nation's output:

$$
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
$$

Where:
- $C$ = Consumption expenditure by households
- $I$ = Investment expenditure by firms
- $G$ = Government purchases
- $X$ = Exports
- $M$ = Imports

#### 3. **Income Approach**

Calculates the total income earned from production, including:
- Wages
- Rent
- Interest
- Profits

This is typically expressed as:

$$
GDP = Wages + Rents + Interest + Profits + Indirect Taxes - Subsidies + Depreciation
$$

**Example:**  
Suppose a country produces only bread and computers.

- 1000 loaves of bread at $2 each = $2,000
- 50 computers at $500 each = $25,000

Total GDP (production approach) = $2,000 + $25,000 = $27,000
