Even written constitutions can be subject to varying interpretations over time. The process of **constitutional interpretation** involves determining the meaning and application of constitutional text.

**Major Approaches:**

1. **Textualism:**  
   Focusing on the explicit wording of the constitution.

   ```text
   Example: Justice Hugo Black famously insisted that “no law” in the First Amendment meant “no law.”
   ```

2. **Originalism:**  
   Interpreting the constitution based on the intentions or understandings of its framers at the time of adoption.

   ```text
   Example: Originalists might examine Federalist Papers to determine the founders’ intentions.
   ```

3. **Living Constitution/Progressivism:**  
   Interpreting constitutional principles in light of evolving societal values and circumstances.

   ```text
   Example: The expansive interpretation of “equal protection” that underlies decisions like Brown v. Board of Education.
   ```

4. **Doctrinal Approach:**  
   Relying on precedents and previous judicial decisions to guide interpretation.

**Why Interpretation Matters:**
- Societies change. New issues arise (e.g., digital privacy) that may not be directly addressed in the original text.
- Ensures that constitutions remain relevant and responsive to contemporary needs while maintaining core principles.

**Case Example:**  
The US Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution’s guarantee of "liberty" in *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015) to require the recognition of same-sex marriage, despite the constitution not mentioning marriage or sexual orientation specifically.
