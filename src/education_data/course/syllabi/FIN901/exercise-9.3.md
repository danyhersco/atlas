**Application and Analysis:**  
You want to start tracking your monthly expenses and set a savings goal of $200 per month. Using the template below, create a simple budget for the next month.

| Category    | Planned Spending | Actual Spending |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Rent        |                 |                |
| Groceries   |                 |                |
| Utilities   |                 |                |
| Transportation |             |                |
| Entertainment |              |                |
| Savings     | $200            |                |

1. Estimate values for each category based on your current lifestyle.
2. Set up a method to record your actual spending during the month (e.g., in a spreadsheet or using an app).
3. At the end of the month, compare planned and actual spending and write two sentences about where you succeeded and where you might improve.
