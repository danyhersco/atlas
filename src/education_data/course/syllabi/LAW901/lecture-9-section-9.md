Case studies are the heartbeat of public law in practice. They show how courts, rights, institutions, and societies interact and evolve, testing the boundaries of law under pressure. By learning to analyze cases methodically, students of law and society become equipped not only to understand past and present developments, but also to critically engage with ongoing debates about law’s role in shaping our collective future.
