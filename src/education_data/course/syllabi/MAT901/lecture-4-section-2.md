A **random variable** is a function that assigns a real number to each outcome in a sample space of a random experiment.

- **Notation**: We typically use uppercase letters like $X$, $Y$, $Z$ for random variables, and lowercase letters like $x$, $y$, $z$ for their possible values.

### Example

Suppose you toss a coin twice.

- Sample space: $S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$
- Let $X$ = number of heads observed.

Then, $X$ is a random variable with possible values $0, 1, 2$ depending on the outcome.
