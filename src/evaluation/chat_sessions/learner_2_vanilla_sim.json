Python doesn’t automatically know “pi,” but you can get it from Python’s built-in `math` module. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Import** the math module to access `pi`.\n2. Get the value of `r` (radius).\n3. Write the formula using Python syntax.\n\nHere’s how that would look:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nr = 5  # you can change this to any value you want\nA = math.pi * r ** 2\nprint(A)\n```\n\n- `math.pi` gives you the value of π.\n- `r ** 2` means “r squared.”\n\nWould you like to try writing it out yourself, or do you want to modify any part of this example?"

If you run it, you’ll see the area for a circle with radius 5.\n\nIf you’d like, try changing the value of `r` to see how the area changes, or try using `r ** 2` instead of `r * r` to see that you get the same result.\n\nWould you like to try another formula next, maybe one with more operations or different math functions?"

So, for a car’s maximum speed, the best name is usually `car_max_speed`.  \n   Alternatively, if you were in a code context where “max_speed” is always referring to a car, `max_speed` alone would work.\n\n3. **Example:**  \n   ```python\n   car_max_speed = 120\n   ```\n\n4. **Putting it all together:**  \n   - `car_maxspeed` ← confusing, missing an underscore\n   - `max_speed_car` ← clear, but less standard order\n   - **`car_max_speed`** ← clear, well-formatted, and follows conventions\n\n**Final answer:**  \n`car_max_speed = 120` is the clearest, following Python’s naming rules and conventions.\n\n**Practice time:**  \nNow, how would you name a variable that stores the number of students in a classroom?

But if you want to make it clear it’s for a classroom (not, say, a whole school), you can add `classroom` at the start: `classroom_number_of_students`.\n\n3. **Use “of” for clarity:**  \n   Using `number_of_students` is more readable than `number_students`.\n\n4. **Final suggestion:**  \n   - `number_of_students = 30` (simple, clear, snake_case)\n   - Or, for extra clarity: `classroom_number_of_students = 30` (if there might be other types of numbers)\n\n**In summary:**  \n`number_of_students = 30` is perfect if your code context is already about classrooms, but `classroom_number_of_students = 30` is also totally correct and even more specific!\n\n**Extra tip:**  \nTry not to make variable names too long unless you need the extra detail for clarity.\n\n**Next challenge:**  \nSuppose you want to store the total price of items in a shopping cart. What would a good variable name look like using these rules? Try writing it!"

Let’s sort out the specifics:\n\n1. **Use underscores between separate words:**  \n   So instead of `shoppingcart`, you should use `shopping_cart`.\n\n2. **Order of the words:**  \n   Start with the main thing—here, it's the **total price** of something (the shopping cart). In Python, a common order is either:\n   - main item first: `shopping_cart_total_price`\n   - or, if you want the emphasis on the value: `total_price_shopping_cart`\n\n   Both are allowed, but `shopping_cart_total_price` is the most common and “natural” in Python. It groups the most important thing first (shopping cart), followed by what aspect you’re describing (total price).\n\n3. **Final answer:**  \n   ```python\n   shopping_cart_total_price = 50.00\n   ```\n\n   This is clear, separated correctly with underscores, and easy for anyone to read!\n\n**Quick recap:**  \n- Use underscores between all words: `shopping_cart`, not `shoppingcart`\n- Main subject first is most common: `shopping_cart_total_price`\n- Stick to lower case and use descriptive names\n\n**Ready for another one?**  \nTry creating a variable for a student’s test score.

If you have many students' scores, you might use `student_test_score` to specify that this is a test score belonging to a student.\n\n3. **Putting it all together:**  \n   - `student_testscore` → close, but missing the underscore between \"test\" and \"score\"  \n   - `testscore_student` → same issue, missing an underscore, and less common order  \n   - **`student_test_score`** → clear, snake_case, commonly used order  \n\n**Final answer:**  \n```python\nstudent_test_score = 95\n```\n\nThis naming follows all Python conventions:  \n- All lowercase  \n- Words separated by underscores  \n- Descriptive and specific\n\n**Extra tip:**  \nIf you're working with just one student's score, `student_test_score` works well.

Here are some best practices for writing helpful, clear comments in Python (and really in any programming language):\n\n1. **Explain Why, Not Just What**  \n   Don’t just repeat what the code says—try to explain *why* you are doing something, or add context that isn’t obvious from the code.  \n   - ✅ Good: `# Convert temperature to Celsius to match API requirements`\n   - 🚫 Not as helpful: `# Convert to Celsius`\n\n2. **Avoid Obvious Comments**  \n   If the code is already clear, you don’t need to restate it.  \n   - 🚫 Not needed: `x = x + 1 # add 1 to x`\n   - ✅ Useful:   `x = x + 1 # Move to the next item in the list`\n\n3. **Update Comments When Code Changes**  \n   If you change your code, make sure your comments are still correct! Outdated comments can be confusing.\n\n4. **Use Comments to Break Up Sections**  \n   Adding blank lines with comments helps organize your code and makes it easier to read.\n   ```python\n   # Initialize counters\n   count = 0\n   total = 0\n\n   # Process each item in the list\n   for item in items:\n       ...\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Docstrings for Functions**  \n   When writing functions, use multi-line comments called \"docstrings\" (with triple quotes) to explain what the function does, its inputs, and its outputs.\n   ```python\n   def add(a, b):\n       \"\"\"\n       Add two numbers and return the result.\n       a: first number\n       b: second number\n       \"\"\"\n       return a + b\n   ```\n\n6. **Be Brief, But Clear**  \n   Write just enough explanation for someone new to your code to understand your intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Comment *why* or *how*, not just what.\n- Avoid stating the obvious.\n- Keep comments updated.\n- Use comments to guide the reader.\n\nWould you like to see examples comparing good and bad comments?

That prints the sentence, but as you noticed, it doesn’t use the variables—so if the values of `name` or `score` change, you’d have to rewrite your print statement each time.\n\nLet's learn how to include *variables* in your output. One modern and easy way in Python is with **f-strings**. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"{name} scored {score} points\")\n```\n\nNotice the `f` before the quotation marks and the curly braces `{}` around the variable names. This tells Python to substitute the variables' values right into the string.\n\nTry updating your code to use `name` and `score` variables with an f-string in a print statement!

Imagine your `score` has a lot of decimal places, like `score = 92.56789`. What if you want to print only two decimal places, so it shows `92.57`?\n\nYou can control the number of decimal places with f-strings by using a format inside the curly braces. Here’s how:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"{name} scored {score:.2f} points\")\n```\n\n- The `:.2f` part means \"float, two digits after the decimal point.\"\n\nWhat do you think this line will print if `score = 92.56789`?"

Operations with higher precedence are performed before those with lower precedence.\n\nHere's a quick rule to remember:\n- **Multiplication (\\*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).**\n- Operators of the same precedence are usually evaluated left to right.\n\nLet’s look at your example:  \n**3 + 5 * 2**\n\nLet's break it down:\n1. First, Python checks for any parentheses—there are none.\n2. Next, it looks for \\*, / (they have higher precedence than +, -).\n3. So Python does **5 \\* 2** first, which is **10**.\n4. Then, it adds 3: so, **3 + 10 = 13**.\n\nSo, **3 + 5 * 2** results in **13**, not **16**.\n\nLet’s try a written breakdown:\n```\nExpression:      3 + 5 * 2\nStep 1 (multiply):   3 + (5 * 2)\nStep 2 (add):        3 + 10\nResult:             13\n```\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n- Parentheses `()` come first—they override everything.\n- Next come multiplication (\\*) and division (/).\n- Then, addition (+) and subtraction (-).\n- If two operations have the same precedence, they’re evaluated left to right.\n\nWould you like to see another example, or maybe try one together?

They happen left to right if they are in the same expression.\n\nSo in **8 + 6 / 2 * 3**:\n- First, do **6 / 2** which is **3**.\n- Then, take that result and do **3 * 3** which is **9**.\n- Finally, do **8 + 9** which is **17**.\n\nWritten step-by-step:\n```\nExpression:              8 + 6 / 2 * 3\nStep 1 (divide):         8 + (6 / 2) * 3    ==> 8 + 3 * 3\nStep 2 (multiply):       8 + (3 * 3)        ==> 8 + 9\nStep 3 (add):                    8 + 9     ==> 17\n```\n\nNotice how *division and multiplication* happen first (left to right for equal precedence), then addition.\n\nYou asked if you could try your own expression—absolutely!

Last, **8 + 9** (addition): 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nSo, **8 + 6 / 2 * 3 = 17**\n\n---\n\n### With Parentheses:  \n**(8 + 6) / 2 * 3**\n\nLet’s follow the steps:\n1. **(8 + 6)** is done first because it’s inside parentheses: 8 + 6 = 14\n2. Next, **14 / 2** (division): 14 / 2 = 7\n3. Lastly, **7 * 3** (multiplication): 7 * 3 = **21**\n\nSo, **(8 + 6) / 2 * 3 = 21**\n\n---\n\n### Why did the result change?\n- Parentheses **always** mean “do this part first,” no matter what.\n- Without parentheses, Python uses operator precedence rules (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).\n- With parentheses, **you** decide which part to do first!\n\n**Summary example:**\n\n| Expression               | Step-by-step                    | Result |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|\n| 8 + 6 / 2 * 3            | 6/2 = 3 → 3*3 = 9 → 8+9 = 17    | 17     |\n| (8 + 6) / 2 * 3          | 8+6 = 14 → 14/2 = 7 → 7*3 = 21  | 21     |\n\nWould you like to try writing an example with parentheses, or work through some more examples together to help get the hang of it?"

Find the log base 10 of 100 (`math.log10(100)`).\n2. Take the square root of that result (`math.sqrt(...)`).\n\nHere’s the code:\n\n```python\nimport math\nresult = math.sqrt(math.log10(100))\nprint(result)\n```\n\n**Breakdown:**\n- `math.log10(100)` is 2 (since 10 squared is 100).\n- `math.sqrt(2)` is about 1.4142.\n\nSo, the answer printed will be approximately `1.4142`.\n\nIf you want to use a different base for the logarithm, just use `math.log(100, base)` instead.\n\nWould you like to try changing the numbers or bases, or would you like to combine even more functions for practice?"

You can't choose not to print.\n\n### Example 2: Print **outside** the function (recommended):\n\n```python\ndef subtract_numbers(numbers):\n    result = numbers[0]\n    for num in numbers[1:]:\n        result -= num\n    return result\n\n# Outside the function:\ndifference = subtract_numbers([10, 2, 3])\nprint(\"The result is:\", difference)\n```\n\n- This lets you use the result however you want (print it, store it, etc.).\n\n### Summary\n\n- If you print **after** `return` inside the function, it will never run.\n- You can print **before** `return`, but it’s usually better to handle printing outside the function for flexibility.\n\nWould you like to try adding a print statement before the return, or practice separating printing and returning?"

Or would you like to see a simple example of local and global variables?"

That means it is a **global variable**—it can be used anywhere in the code, including inside functions.\n- `y` is created inside `my_function()`. That means `y` is a **local variable**—it only exists inside that function.\n- If you try to print `y` outside the function (the last line), Python will give an error because `y` only exists while the function is running and only inside that function.\n\nWould you like to try to predict what will be printed when this code is run, and what happens at the end?

For `y` outside, remember:  \n- Local variables like `y` exist *only* inside the function where they’re created.\n- Trying to use them outside causes an error.\n\nWould you like to see what happens if you want a function to change a global variable, or do you want to try writing a short example yourself first?"

            "content": "Excellent question! Yes, if you want a variable to be used both inside and outside a function, that's when **global variables** come in. Let’s see how this works:\n\n### 1. Defining a Global Variable\n\nIf you define a variable *outside* any function, it has global scope. That means both your main code and your functions can read it:\n\n```python\ngreeting = \"Hello!\"  # global variable\n\ndef greet_user():\n    print(\"Inside the function:\", greeting)\n\ngreet_user()\nprint(\"Outside the function:\", greeting)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nInside the function: Hello!\nOutside the function: Hello!\n```\n\nBoth prints work, because `greeting` is global.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Changing a Global Variable Inside a Function\n\nNormally, if you try to **change** a global variable from inside a function, you have to tell Python you mean the global one, not a new local variable. You do this with the keyword `global`:\n\n```python\ncount = 0\n\ndef increment():\n    global count   # tells Python to use the global 'count'\n    count = count + 1\n    print(\"Inside the function:\", count)\n\nincrement()\nprint(\"Outside the function:\", count)\n```\n\n**Both** prints show the updated `count`.\n\n---\n\n**Quick Recap:**\n- If you *only* read a global variable inside a function, you just refer to it.\n- If you want to *change* a global variable inside a function, you must add the keyword `global` inside the function (otherwise, Python will create a new local variable instead).\n\nWould you like to practice by writing a function that changes a global variable, or do you want to ask more about why or when you’d use global and local variables?"

That tells Python, “Hey, when I talk about this variable name, I mean the one from outside the function.”\n\nLet’s walk through an example together step by step:\n\n1. **Create a global variable outside the function.**\n2. **Write a function.**  \n   - Inside the function, add `global` followed by the variable name.\n   - Change the global variable.\n   - Print its value inside the function.\n3. **Call the function, and print the variable outside the function to see its new value.**\n\nHere’s a template you could use:\n\n```python\nscore = 0  # global variable\n\ndef add_point():\n    global score\n    score = score + 1\n    print(\"Inside the function, score =\", score)\n\nadd_point()\nprint(\"Outside the function, score =\", score)\n```\n\n### Your turn!\nTry coming up with your own example. You could use any variable name, and you can have the function add, subtract, or edit the variable. If you like, just replace `score` with your favorite word.\n\nWrite your code, and I’ll explain exactly what happens step by step!"

When you call `double_number()`, Python sees the line `global number`, so inside the function, any changes to `number` will affect the global variable.\n3. Inside the function: `number = number * 2` → `number` becomes 10.\n4. Prints: **Inside the function: 10**\n5. After the function, you print `number` again.\n6. Prints: **Outside the function: 10**\n\nBoth prints will show **10** because you successfully doubled the global variable and changed it everywhere.\n\n**You did everything right!**  \nWant to try another example, or would you like to know why using global variables should be done carefully?

            "content": "That’s a really thoughtful question! It does seem easier at first—but using global variables everywhere can actually cause **big problems** in your programs, especially as they get bigger or more complex. Here’s why:\n\n### 1. **Hard to Track Changes**\nWhen lots of different functions can change a global variable, it’s easy to lose track of where and why something changed. This can lead to bugs that are very hard to find, because you don’t know *which* part of the code changed the variable.\n\n### 2. **Functions Become Less Reusable**\nIf a function always uses and changes global variables, it **can’t easily be reused** in other parts of your program, or in other programs, unless those variables exist with the exact same names.\n\n### 3. **Unexpected Side Effects**\nFunctions that change global variables can accidentally create surprising changes elsewhere in the code—this is called a **side effect**. For example, you might change a variable in one place and not realize it breaks something that depends on it far away in your program.\n\n### 4. **Makes Debugging Harder**\nIf something goes wrong, it’s much harder to figure out *where* the problem is, because any code can affect the global variables.\n\n---\n\n#### **What should you do instead?**\n- **Prefer local variables:** Create and use variables inside functions as much as possible.\n- **Pass values as arguments:** If your function needs data, pass it in as an argument.\n- **Return results:** If your function calculates something, return the result and use it outside.\n\n#### **Example:**\nInstead of changing a global, you can write:\n\n```python\ndef double_number(n):\n    return n * 2\n\nnumber = 5\nnumber = double_number(number)\nprint(number)  # prints 10\n```\nHere, `double_number` does not depend on any global variable. It works with whatever you give it, and returns the result—no chance of messing up anything else!\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** Using local variables and passing values makes your code easier to read, reuse, and debug. Globals are sometimes necessary—but it’s best to use them only when you really have to!\n\nWould you like to practice writing a function using only local variables, or ask about any part of this explanation?"

Using keywords lets you specify values without worrying about the order after the positional arguments.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `make_sandwich(\"sourdough\", \"chicken\", cheese=\"swiss\", veggies=\"tomato\")`\n\n- **bread:** sourdough (positional)\n- **meat:** chicken (positional, overrides default)\n- **cheese:** swiss (specified by keyword)\n- **veggies:** tomato (specified by keyword)\n\n**Output:**  \nYour sandwich has sourdough bread, chicken, swiss cheese, and tomato.\n\n> ✅ Mixing positional and keyword arguments is allowed, as long as positional arguments come first. You did this right!\n\n---\n\n### Recap/Tips\n\n- Positional arguments go first, matching parameter order.\n- After you start using keyword arguments in a call, all following arguments should also be keywords (but you can mix, as you did, as long as keywords come last).\n- Default values \"fill in\" whenever you don’t supply an argument.\n\n---\n\nYou’re doing great!

I’ll check your answer and explain anything tricky about it."

Or do the keywords have to go in the same order as the definition? Also, if I did `make_sandwich(meat=\"roast beef\", \"multigrain\", cheese=\"provolone\", veggies=\"spinach\")`, I think that’s wrong because the positional `\"multigrain\"` comes after a keyword.

This is allowed and will work as you intended.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `make_sandwich(meat=\"roast beef\", \"multigrain\", cheese=\"provolone\", veggies=\"spinach\")`\n\n- Here, you try to use a keyword argument (`meat=\"roast beef\"`) *before* a positional argument (`\"multigrain\"`).\n- **This will raise an error**:  \n  `SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument`\n\n**Why?**  \nOnce you use a keyword argument, **all following arguments must also be keyword arguments**. You can’t switch back to positional after a keyword.\n\n---\n\n#### Rule to Remember\n\n> **Positional arguments always first. After a keyword argument appears, all remaining arguments must use keywords, in any order.**\n\n---\n\n**Great job** spotting the problem and thinking it through!

Loops are really helpful when you want to repeat a task several times without writing the same code over and over. \n\nTo start, have you seen code that repeats an action, like printing numbers from 1 to 5? In Python, you might use a **loop** for that. Here’s an example using a **for loop**:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis code prints numbers 1 through 5, one per line. The loop makes it happen automatically.\n\nCan you guess why using a loop is helpful in this case, instead of writing five separate print statements?"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Yes! Using a loop is helpful because it lets us repeat the same action multiple times without having to write separate lines of code for each step. It’s less repetitive, saves time, and makes the code easier to change—like, if you want to print 1 to 100, you just change the range instead of writing 100 print statements."

        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Exactly right! Loops help make code shorter, easier to read, and much easier to modify if you need to change how many times an action happens.\n\nThere are two main types of loops in Python: **for loops** and **while loops**. You’ve just seen a for loop, which is good when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something.\n\nThe second type is the **while loop**. A while loop keeps repeating as long as a certain condition is true. For example:\n\n```python\ncount = 1\nwhile count <= 5:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1\n```\n\nThis will also print numbers 1 through 5. The difference is that you control the loop using a condition.\n\nWhat do you think would happen if we forgot to increase `count` inside the while loop?"

Loops don’t care if the list has 3, 30, or 300 items—they’ll work just the same!\n\n3. **Explore while loops**  \n   Practice using a `while` loop for counting. For example, count up from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.\n\n4. **Nested loops**  \n   Once you feel comfortable, try out “loops within loops” (nested loops)—for example, to compare items in two lists.\n\nYou’re doing fantastic.

The while loop is great when you want to repeat some code as long as a certain condition is True.\n\nLet’s take a look at a simple structure:\n\n```python\ncount = 0\nwhile count < 5:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The condition is `count < 5`.\n- As long as `count` is less than 5, the code inside the loop runs.\n- Each time the loop runs, `count` increases by 1.\n\nNotice how the code inside the loop is indented. In Python, indentation is how we define what belongs inside the loop!\n\nWould you like to try writing a basic while loop now? You can start by printing the numbers from 1 to 3. Give it a shot!"

Then `num` becomes 2.\n    - Second time: `num` is 2, print 2. Then `num` becomes 3.\n    - Third time: `num` is 3, but the condition `num < 3` is now False, so the loop stops.\n\nSo your code will print:\n```\n1\n2\n```\n\nIf you want to print numbers from 1 **to 3**, what change should you make to the condition?

Here’s the corrected version:\n\n```python\ncount = 5\nwhile count >= 1:\n    print(count)\n    count -= 1\n```\nNow, the loop will print:\n```\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n```\n\nGreat work understanding how the condition affects your loop!  \nWould you like to know what happens if you forget to update `count` inside the loop?"

The program will print 5 forever and never stop unless you interrupt it.\n\nThis is why it’s important to:\n1. **Initialize** your loop variable correctly (e.g., `count = 5`).\n2. **Update** your loop variable inside the loop (e.g., `count -= 1`).\n3. **Choose the right condition** so your loop eventually stops (e.g., `while count >= 1`).\n\nWould you like to experiment with another while loop, or do you want an example that uses user input to control the loop?"

The loop updates the value of `password` each time.\n- If the user types anything other than \"secret\", the loop continues.\n- When the user types \"secret\", the condition is False and the loop ends.  \n- The program then prints \"Access granted!\"\n\nNotice again the indentation: the code inside the loop (the `input()` line) is indented.\n\nWould you like to try modifying this example, or do you want to add more features (like counting tries)?"

The user enters the correct password, **and**\n2. The number of attempts reaches the maximum.\n\n**This is not what you want** for a password check! That’s why we use `and`—it makes sure the loop stops as soon as one condition is no longer true.\n\n**Quick summary:**\n- `while A and B` — both must be True for the loop to run.\n- `while A or B` — only one must be True for the loop to run.\n\nDoes that help make sense of loop conditions with `and` vs `or`?

Adding items to a list**\n\n- The main method is `.append()`.  \n  It adds a new item to the *end* of your list.\n\nExample:\n```python\nmy_colors.append(\"orange\")\nprint(my_colors)  # Output: [\"blue\", \"green\", \"purple\", \"orange\"]\n```\n\n- If you want to add an item at a specific position, use `.insert(index, value)`.\n\nExample:\n```python\nmy_colors.insert(1, \"yellow\")  \nprint(my_colors)  # Output: [\"blue\", \"yellow\", \"green\", \"purple\", \"orange\"]\n```\nHere, `\"yellow\"` was placed at index 1 (between `\"blue\"` and `\"green\"`).\n\n**There is no `.add()` method for lists** (that’s sometimes used in other languages or for different data types in Python, but not for lists).\n\n---\n\n**2. Removing items from a list**\n\n- To remove by value, use `.remove(item)`.\n\nExample:\n```python\nmy_colors.remove(\"green\")\nprint(my_colors)  # Removes \"green\" from the list\n```\n\n- To remove by position (index), use `.pop(index)`. If you leave the index out, it removes the last item.\n\nExample:\n```python\nmy_colors.pop(2)  # Removes item at index 2\nmy_colors.pop()   # Removes the last item\n```\n\n**There is no `.delete()` method for lists**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to try using `.append()` and `.remove()` yourself?

Here’s the basic structure:\n\n```python\nfor item in list_name:\n    # do something with item\n```\n\nLet’s see this in action. Using your `colors` list, we can print each color like this:\n\n```python\ncolors = [\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"]\n\nfor color in colors:\n    print(color)\n```\n\nThis loop goes through each item in `colors`, and `color` takes the value of each element one at a time. So the output would be:\n```\nred\nblue\ngreen\n```\n\nWould you like to try changing the action inside the loop?

For example, how would you make a list of the cubes of numbers from 0 to 4?"

So the result would be:  \n[0, 3, 6, 9, 12]\n\nBut to get the cubes (raising each number to the third power), you want to use ** (the exponentiation operator):\n\n```python\ncubes = [x ** 3 for x in range(5)]\n```\n\nThis will give you:  \n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nTry changing your code to use x ** 3.

Now you’re getting the hang of list comprehensions.\n\nLet's try adding a small twist. Suppose you only want the cubes of even numbers from 0 to 9. You can add an if-condition at the end of your list comprehension:\n\n```python\neven_cubes = [x ** 3 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis will include x in the list only if x is even.\n\nWant to guess what even_cubes will look like if you print it?

In this list, the first letters are already lowercase, so it doesn't change them, but it’s a good habit if you’re not sure whether the words might have uppercase letters!\n\nSo your list comprehension:\n```python\n[x[0].lower() for x in ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']]\n```\nwill produce:\n```python\n['d', 'c', 'b']\n```\n\nAnd you’re absolutely right—sometimes, adding `.lower()` is optional if you know your data.

You often use them to “flatten” a list of lists, or to perform operations on each element of a 2D list (like a matrix).\n\n**Example scenario:**  \nSuppose you have a 2D list (a list of lists) like this:\n\n```python\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [4, 5, 6],\n    [7, 8, 9]\n]\n```\n\nLet’s say you want to create a single, flat list of every element in \"matrix\".\n\nHere’s how you could do it as a nested for-loop:\n\n```python\nflattened = []\nfor row in matrix:\n    for num in row:\n        flattened.append(num)\n```\n\nAnd here’s the **nested list comprehension** version:\n\n```python\nflattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]\n```\n\nNotice how both for-clauses appear in a single line, following the order as they’re nested!\n\n**Try it yourself:**  \nWhat if you wanted to create a new list of all the numbers in \"matrix\" *doubled* (i.e., each value times 2)?  \nTry writing a nested list comprehension for that.
