Fundamental rights are continually tested by evolving social, technological, and political realities.

### 1. Surveillance and Privacy

- Expanded digital surveillance powers can threaten the right to privacy.
- How should courts balance public safety (e.g., against terrorism) with personal rights?

#### Example (Hypothetical):
A government mandates that all electronic communications be accessible to authorities without a warrant. Does this violate privacy rights? Most courts would require judicial oversight.

### 2. Freedom of Speech and Hate Speech

- Where is the line between protected speech and punishable hate speech?
- Should online platforms be compelled to regulate speech?

### 3. Rights of Minorities and Equality

- Ongoing debates regarding discrimination based on gender, race, religion, and sexuality.
- Affirmative action policies: Necessary for equity, or a form of reverse discrimination?

### 4. Emergency Powers (e.g., during pandemics)

- Lockdowns and mass quarantines may restrain movement and assembly rights.
- What limits should exist on executive power during emergencies?
