Understanding public law means recognizing the two dominant legal traditions: civil law and common law. Both traditions arose from distinct historical contexts and continue to shape legal systems globally.

### Civil Law Tradition

- *Origins*: Emerged from Roman law; codified, systematic, and comprehensive.
- *Development*: The Napoleonic Code (1804) is a seminal codification, influencing Continental Europe and many countries worldwide.
- *Features*: Emphasis on written statutes; less reliance on judicial precedent.

### Common Law Tradition

- *Origins*: Developed in medieval England.
- *Development*: King’s courts created a body of precedents; Magna Carta (1215) laid the groundwork for certain public rights.
- *Features*: Reliance on judicial decisions (case law); doctrine of precedent (stare decisis).

#### Example: Habeas Corpus
Originating in English common law, _habeas corpus_ (“you shall have the body”) is a legal principle safeguarding individual liberty against arbitrary detention, demonstrating the importance of public law in protecting rights.

### Other Legal Traditions

- *Customary Law*: Diverse local practices, often unwritten, as seen in parts of Africa and the Pacific.
- *Religious Law*: Applies in varying degrees in nations like Iran (Islamic law) or Israel (Jewish law).
