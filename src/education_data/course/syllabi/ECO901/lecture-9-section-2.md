At the center of monetary policy is the **central bank**—for example, the Federal Reserve (Fed) in the United States, the European Central Bank (ECB) in the Eurozone, or the Bank of England in the UK.

**Central banks** are responsible for:

- Issuing and regulating the national currency
- Controlling the supply of money in the economy
- Setting key interest rates that influence all other rates in the economy
- Acting as a lender of last resort to the banking system

Central banks are generally independent from direct government control, to avoid political influence over crucial economic decisions.

### Objectives of Central Banks

Most central banks have one or more of these mandates:

- **Price Stability**: Keeping inflation low and steady.
- **Maximum Employment**: Promoting high employment levels.
- **Economic Growth and Stability**: Smoothing out business cycles and avoiding deep recessions.

For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve's dual mandate is to achieve "maximum employment" and "stable prices."
