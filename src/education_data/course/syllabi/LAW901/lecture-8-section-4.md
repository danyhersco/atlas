Understanding application reinforces theory. Let’s look at a few notable real-world examples of how public law supports or challenges democratic institutions.

### Example 1: Germany’s Basic Law (Grundgesetz)

After World War II, Germany’s constitution was deliberately drafted to create strong public law mechanisms:
- The Federal Constitutional Court can dissolve political parties that threaten democracy.
- Strict rules for emergency powers prevent abuses seen under earlier regimes.

### Example 2: United States – Judicial Review and the Civil Rights Movement

- U.S. courts, through the interpretation of constitutional rights, played a central role in dismantling segregation laws and expanding democratic participation (e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 1954).

### Example 3: India’s Anti-Defection Law

- To protect the stability and legitimacy of parliamentary democracy, Indian law disallows elected representatives from switching parties for personal gain, addressing the problem of “floor crossing.”

### Example 4: Challenges – Turkey and Poland

In recent years, legal reforms in Turkey and Poland have weakened judicial independence, raising concerns about democratic backsliding. These examples underscore the ongoing struggle to safeguard democratic institutions through public law.
