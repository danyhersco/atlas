Not all savings accounts are the same. It’s crucial to understand the different forms available to help your money grow and remain accessible.

### Common Types

1. **Basic Savings Account**
    - Offered by most banks and credit unions.
    - Low (but usually non-zero) interest.
    - Highly liquid—can withdraw anytime.
2. **High-Yield Savings Account**
    - Often available online.
    - Higher interest rates compared to traditional banks.
    - Generally no monthly fees; sometimes withdrawal restrictions.
3. **Money Market Account**
    - Mixes features of checking and savings accounts.
    - Possibly higher interest rates than regular savings.
    - May require higher minimum balances.
4. **Certificates of Deposit (CDs)**
    - Commit to leaving funds deposited for a set time (e.g., 6 months, 1 year).
    - Higher fixed interest rate.
    - Penalties if you withdraw before maturity.
    - **Note:** Not ideal for emergency funds due to withdrawal restrictions.

### Choosing an Account

- **Accessibility:** Emergency funds should be easily accessible (savings/high-yield accounts).
- **Interest Rate:** Higher is better, but don’t sacrifice liquidity for rate with your emergency fund.
- **Fees/Minimums:** Avoid accounts that charge high fees or require large minimum balances, especially for starting savers.
