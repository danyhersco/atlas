In this lecture, you have learned:

- How to define and construct sample spaces and events.
- The classification of events (simple, compound, mutually exclusive, independent).
- How to apply the addition and multiplication rules, and to recognize when to use each.
- The importance of complementary events and how to use them in probability computations.

Take time to work through the exercises, and try to express problems you encounter in terms of well-defined sample spaces and events. This will be critical for all later work in probability and statistics!
