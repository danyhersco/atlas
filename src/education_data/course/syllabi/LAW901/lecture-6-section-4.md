Federal systems require ongoing negotiation between levels of government, as few issues deal exclusively with one level.

### Mechanisms for Interaction

- **Fiscal Federalism:** Distribution of resources (taxes, grants) between levels. E.g., federal grants to states for health or education.
- **Cooperative Federalism:** Collaborative policy-making and implementation; often seen in environmental, health, or infrastructure initiatives.
- **Executive Federalism:** Direct negotiation and decision-making between executive branches (e.g., meetings of premiers/chief ministers and the federal executive).

#### Example: Germany

Germany’s *Bundesrat* (Federal Council) is an institution where states participate directly in federal law-making, especially on matters affecting state competencies.

#### Potential Conflicts

Disputes may arise when:
- There is an unclear or overlapping authority.
- Fiscal imbalances lead to dependence of one level on another.
- Political interests diverge significantly across levels.

Courts, particularly constitutional courts, play a central role in resolving these disputes.
